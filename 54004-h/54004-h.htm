<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> embody in a condensed form some
salient features of the present status of Food Adulteration in the
United States is the object of this volume. The importance of the
subject, and the apparent need of a book of moderate dimensions
relating thereto, must suffice as its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i>.
The standard works have been freely consulted, and valuable data have
been obtained from the recent reports of our State and Civic Boards of
Health. The system of nomenclature accepted by the American Chemical
Society has been generally adopted. It was, however, deemed advisable
to retain such names as glycerine, sodium bicarbonate, etc., in place
of the more modern but less well-known terms, glycerol and sodium
hydrogen carbonate, even at a slight sacrifice of uniformity.</p>

<p>The photogravure plates, most of which represent the results of
recent microscopical investigation, are considered an important feature
of the book. And it is believed that the bibliographical appendix, and
the collation of American Legislation on Adulteration, will supply a
want for ready reference often experienced.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the various branches cognate to
chemical research which excite public attention, that of food
adulteration doubtless possesses the greatest interest. To the dealer
in alimentary substances, the significance of their sophistication is
frequently merely one of profit or loss, and even this comparatively
unimportant consideration does not always attach. But to the general
community, the subject appeals to interests more vital than a desire
to avoid pecuniary damage, and involving, as it necessarily does,
the question of health, it has engendered a feeling of uneasiness,
accompanied by an earnest desire for trustworthy information and data.
The most usual excuses advanced by dishonest traders, when a case of
adulteration has been successfully brought home to them&mdash;guilty
knowledge being also established&mdash;are, that they are compelled to
resort to the misdeed by the public demand for cheap commodities, that
the addition is harmless, or actually constitutes an improvement, as
is asserted to be the case when chicory is added to coffee, or that it
serves as a preservative, as was formerly alleged to be the fact when
vinegar was fortified with sulphuric acid. Pretexts of this sort are
almost invariably fallacious. The claim that manufacturers are often
forced into adulteration by the necessities of unfair trade competition
possesses more weight&mdash;an honest dealer cannot as a rule
successfully compete with a dishonest one&mdash;and has undoubtedly
influenced many of the better class to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> co-operate in attempts to
prevent the practice. The general feeling of uncertainty which exists
in the public mind concerning the actual extent and importance of food
adulteration is probably to be ascribed to two causes. In the first
place, most of the literature generally accessible relating to the
subject has been limited to sensational newspaper articles, reciting
some startling instance of food-poisoning, often unauthenticated and
bearing upon its face evidences of exaggeration. By reason of such
publications, periodical panics have been created in our large cities
which, however, as a rule quickly subside, and the community relapses
into the customary feeling of doubtful security, until aroused from its
apathy by the next <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">expos&eacute;</i>. The fact that the only reliable results
of food investigation have, until recently, been confined to purely
scientific journals, and therefore not prominently brought to public
notice, is another explanation of the lack of creditable information
which generally prevails concerning this species of sophistication.</p>

<p>The adulteration of alimentary substances was practised in the
civilised countries of Europe at a very remote date, and the early
history of the art, mainly collated by Prof. Blyth in his valuable
work on food,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is replete with interest.
Bread certainly received due attention at the hands of the ancient
sophisticator. Pliny makes several references to the adulteration of
this food. In England, as early as the reign of King John, the sale
of the commodity was controlled by the &#8220;Assize of Bread,&#8221;
which, although originally designed to regulate the price and size
of the loaf, was subsequently amplified so as to include penalties
for falsification, usually consisting of corporal punishment and
exposure in the pillory. In France, in 1382, ordinances were
promulgated specifying the proper mode of bread-making, the punishment
for infringement being similar in character to those inflicted in
Great Britain. It is related that in the year 1525, a guilty baker
&#8220;was condemned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> the court to be taken from the Ch&acirc;telet
prison to the cross before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&Eacute;glise des Carmes</i>, and thence to
the gate of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre Dame</i> and to other public places in Paris, in his
shirt, having his head and feet bare, with small loaves hung from his
neck, and holding a large wax candle, lighted, and in each of the
places enumerated he was to make <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</i>, and ask mercy
and pardon of God, the king, and of justice for his fault.&#8221; In
Germany, during the fifteenth century, the bread adulterator, while not
subjected to a religious penance, did not escape from a sufficiently
practical rebuke, as it was the frequent custom to put him in a basket
attached to a long pole, and purge him of his misdeeds by repeated
immersions in a pool of water.</p>

<p>Wine would also appear to have been exposed to fraudulent admixture
in former times. Pliny mentions that in Rome considerable difficulty
was experienced, even by the wealthy, in securing the pure article,
and in Athens a public inspector was early appointed to prevent its
adulteration. In England, during the reign of Edward the Confessor,
punishment for brewing bad beer was publicly enforced, and, in 1529,
official &#8220;ale tasters&#8221; flourished, without whose approval
the beverage was not to be sold. In later years, Addison, referring
to the manipulators of wine of his time, writes: &#8220;These subtle
philosophers are daily employed in the transmutation of liquors,
and, by the power of magical drugs and incantations, raise under the
streets of London the choicest products of the hills and valleys of
France; they squeeze Bordeaux out of the sloe and draw champagne
from an apple.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In the fifteenth century,
at Biebrich on the Rhine, a wine sophisticator was forced to drink six
quarts of his own stock, and it is recorded with due gravity that the
test resulted fatally. Not very many years since, a manufacturer of
wine at Rheims secured for his champagne, which was chiefly consumed
in W&uuml;rtemberg, a high reputation, on account of the unusually<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
exhilarating effects following its use. Suspicion being at length
aroused, Liebig made a chemical examination of the article, and found
that it was at least unique in its gaseous composition, being charged
with one volume of carbonic acid gas and two volumes of nitrous oxide,
or &#8220;laughing gas.&#8221; These early attempts to control and
punish adulteration, while often possessing interest on account of
their quaintness, are chiefly important, as being the precursors of the
protective legal measures which exist in more modern times.</p>

<p>In 1802 the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conseil de Salubrit&eacute;</i> was established in Paris, and
this body has since developed into numerous health boards, to whom
the French are at present mainly indebted for what immunity from food
falsification they enjoy. A very decided advance upon all preceding
methods to regulate the public supply of food was signalised in 1874
by the organisation in England of the Society of Public Analysts, who
formulated a legal definition of adulteration, and issued the standards
of purity which articles of general consumption should meet. This
society was supported in its valuable services by the enactment, in
1875, of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, which, with the amendment
added in 1879, seems to embrace all necessary safeguards against
the offences sought to be suppressed. The results of their work are
tabulated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The American characteristic of controlling their own personal
affairs, and the resulting disinclination to resort to anything
savouring of parental governmental interference, has probably had
its effect in retarding early systematic action in the matter of
adulteration. Sporadic attempts to secure legislative restrictions
have, it is true, occasionally been made, but the laws passed were
almost invariably of a specific nature, designed to meet some isolated
case, and were destined to share the fate of most legislation of
the kind&mdash;the particular adulteration being for the nonce
suppressed, the law became practically a dead letter. Subsequent<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> effort
to obtain more comprehensive laws inclined to the other extreme, and
the enactments secured were so general in scope, and so deficient in
details, that loopholes were inadvertently allowed to remain, through
which the crafty adulterator often managed to escape.</p>

<p>The present food legislation in the United States was to some extent
anticipated in 1848 by an Act of Congress to secure the purity of
imported drugs. In this enactment these are directed to be tested by
the standards established by the various official pharmacop&#339;ias;
twenty-three are specifically enumerated, the most important being
Peruvian bark and opium. The Act is still in force. All previous
efforts to regulate the quality of our food supply culminated in
1877 in formal action being taken by several of the State Boards of
Health, at whose instance laws against adulteration were formulated,
and chemists commissioned to collect and examine samples of alimentary
substances, and furnish reports on the subject. These may be found in
the publications of the same, notably in the volumes issued by the
New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey Boards. The service
rendered to the public by these investigations is almost incalculable,
and the annual reports containing the results of the same are fraught
with interest. For the first time we are placed in possession of
trustworthy statistics, indicating the extent of food sophistication in
this country.</p>

<p>In interpreting the significance of the foregoing table, it should
be borne in mind that in the vast majority of cases the adulterations
practised were not of an injurious nature, but consisted of a
fraudulent admixture of some cheaper substance, the object being an
increase of bulk or weight resulting in augmented profit.</p>

<p>Much of the embarrassment experienced by health authorities
in their efforts to bring persons guilty of food adulteration to
punishment is due to the lack of explicit detail in the law. It is
far easier to substantiate the fact of the adulteration than it is
to produce the offender in court and secure his conviction. Numerous
cases are on record illustrating the peculiar contingencies which at
times arise. Probably with the best intention, a milk vendor labelled
his wagon, &#8220;Country skimmed milk, sold as adulterated;&#8221;
an inspector bought a sample, not noticing the label, and the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> magistrate
convicted the vendor, doubtless on the ground that due attention
had not been directed to the advertisement.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Chief Justice Cockburn, in referring to an analogous case, said:
&#8220;If the seller chooses to sell an article with a certain
admixture, the onus lies on him to prove that the purchaser knew
what he was purchasing.&#8221; In most instances, when in ostensible
compliance with the law, a package bears a label purporting to state
the actual nature of its contents, the label is either printed in such
small type, or is placed in so inconspicuous a position, that the buyer
is in ignorance of its existence at the time the purchase is made. A
confectioner in Boston was suspected of selling adulterated candy, and
while it was proved that a sample bought of him contained a dangerous
proportion of a poisonous pigment&mdash;chromate of lead&mdash;he
escaped conviction, on the plea that candy was not an article of food
within the meaning of the existing law, which, it seems, has since been
amended so as to embrace cases of this kind.</p>

<p>In a recent action brought by the New York Board of Health to obtain
an injunction against the sale of certain Ping Suey teas, it was held
by the court, in refusing to grant the same, that, although the teas in
question had been clearly shown to be adulterated with gypsum, Prussian
blue, sand, etc., it was likewise necessary to prove that the effect of
these admixtures was such as to constitute a serious danger to public
health.</p>

<p>As a result of the publicity lately given to the subject of food
adulteration, a popular impression has been produced that any substance
employed as an adulterant of, or a substitute for another, is to be
avoided <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">per se</i>. Perhaps the common belief that for all purposes
cotton-seed oil is inferior to olive oil, and oleomargarine to butter,
is the most striking illustration of this tendency. Now, as a matter
of fact, pure cotton-seed oil, as at present found on the market,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> is less
liable to become rancid than the product of the olive, and, for
many culinary uses, it is at least quite as serviceable. Absolute
cleanliness is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> in the successful manufacture of
oleomargarine, and, as an economical substitute for the inferior kinds
of butter often exposed for sale, its discovery cannot justly be
regarded a misfortune. The sale of these products, <em>under their true
name</em>, should not only be allowed, but under some circumstances even
encouraged.</p>

<p>The benefits accruing to the community by reason of the service of
our State Boards of Health are so evident and so important, that it is
almost incredible that these bodies have not been put in possession of
all the facilities necessary for their work. It would appear, however,
that, while our legislators have been induced to enact good laws
regulating adulteration, they have often signally failed to fulfil all
the requirements indispensable to the efficient execution of the same.
Without entering into the details of this branch of the subject, it
is proper to observe that owing to the lack of necessary funds, great
pecuniary embarrassment has been experienced in securing the services
of a competent corps of experts, who, in addition to their inadequate
remuneration, must incur the expenses of purchasing samples. The
appointment of public analysts in our larger towns and cities&mdash;as
has for some time been the case in Great Britain&mdash;is certainly to
be urgently recommended.</p>

<p>All attempts to awaken public interest in the subject of food
adulteration are of any real service only as they may be conducive to
the adoption of more advanced and improved measures for the suppression
of the practice.</p>

<p>In general, the adulterations to which food is subjected may be
divided into those positively deleterious to health (such as the
colouring of confectionery by chrome yellow), those which are only
fraudulent (such as the addition of flour to mustard), and those
which may be fairly considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> as accidental (such as the presence of
a small amount of sand in tea). It would exceed the limits of this
volume to enter into a comprehensive review of the almost endless
varieties of adulteration. The following list embraces the articles
most exposed to falsification, together with the adulterants commonly
employed:&mdash;</p>

<p>The above table includes those admixtures which have actually been
detected by chemists of repute within the past few years, and omits
many rather sensational forms of adulteration mentioned in the early
treatises on the subject, the practice of which appears to have been
discontinued.</p>

<p>In the following pages, some of the more important<span

of food and drink are described with especial reference to their

<h2>TEA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> early history of tea is probably contemporary with
that of China, although, in that country, the first authentic
mention of the plant was as late as <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 350; while, in
European literature, its earliest notice occurs in the year
1550. The first important consignment of tea into
England took place in 1657. Chinese tea made its appearance
in the United States in 1711; in 1858, the importation
of Japan tea began. During the season of 1883-1884,
the importation of tea into this country<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was&mdash;from China,
30&frac12; millions of pounds; from Japan, 32&frac12; millions of
pounds. Recently, numerous shipments of Indian tea
have been placed upon our markets, the quality of which
compares very favourably with the older and better known
varieties. During the past four years the consumption of
tea in this country has materially decreased; whilst that
of coffee has undergone an almost corresponding increase.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</i> consumption of tea and coffee in the
United States as compared with that of Great Britain is
as follows:&mdash;United States, tea, 1&middot;16; coffee, 9&middot;50; Great
Britain, tea, 4&middot;62; coffee, 0&middot;89. In the year 1885 our
importation of tea approximated 82 millions of pounds,
that of coffee being nearly 455 millions of pounds.</p>

<p>Genuine tea is the prepared leaf of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thea sinensis</i>. The
growth of the tea shrub is usually restricted by artificial
means to a height of from three to five feet. It is ready
for picking at the end of the third year, the average life of
the plant being about ten years. The first picking is made
in the middle of April, the second on the 1st of May, the
third in the middle of July, and occasionally a fourth during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the month of August. The first pickings, which obviously
consist of the young and more tender leaves, furnish the
finer grades of tea. After sorting, the natural moisture of
the leaves is partially removed by pressing and rolling;
they are next more thoroughly dried by gently roasting in
iron pans for a few minutes. The leaves are then rolled
on bamboo tables and again roasted, occasionally re-rolled
and re-fired, and finally separated into the various kinds,
such as twankay, hyson, young hyson, gunpowder, etc.,
by passing through sieves. The difference between green
and black tea is mainly due to the fact that the former is
dried shortly after gathering, and then rolled and carefully
fired, whereas black tea is first made up into heaps, which
are exposed to the air for some time before firing and
allowed to undergo a species of fermentation, resulting in
the conversion of its original olive-green into a black colour.
The methods employed in the preparation of the tea are
somewhat modified in their details in the different tea
districts of China and Japan. In Japan two varieties of
the leaf are used, which are termed &#8220;otoko&#8221; (male), and
&#8220;ona&#8221; (female), the former being larger and coarser than
the latter. After picking, the leaves are steamed by placing
them in a wooden tray suspended over boiling water, in
which they are allowed to remain for about half a minute.
They are next thrown upon a tough paper membrane
attached to the top of an oven, which is heated by burning
charcoal covered with ashes, where they are constantly
manipulated by the hand until the light-green colour turns
to a dark olive, and the leaves have become spirally twisted.
After this &#8220;firing,&#8221; the tea is dried at a low temperature
for from four to eight hours; it is next sorted by passing
through sieves, and is then turned over to the &#8220;go-downs,&#8221;
or warehouses of the foreigners, where the facing process is
carried on by placing the tea in large metallic bowls, heated
by means of a furnace, and gradually adding the various
pigments used, the mixture being continually stirred. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
tea is finally again sorted by means of large fans, and is
now ready for packing and shipment.</p>

<p>The sophistications to which tea is exposed have received
the careful attention of chemists, but not to a greater extent
than the importance of the subject merits; indeed, it is safe
to assert that no article among alimentary substances has
been, at least in past years, more subjected to adulteration.
The falsifications which are practised to no inconsiderable
extent may be conveniently divided into three classes.</p>

<p>1st. Additions made for the purpose of giving increased
weight and bulk, which include foreign leaves and spent tea
leaves, and also certain mineral substances, such as metallic
iron, sand, brick-dust, etc.</p>

<p>2nd. Substances added in order to produce an artificial
appearance of strength to the tea decoction, catechu and
other bodies rich in tannin being mainly resorted to for
this purpose.</p>

<p>3rd. The imparting of a bright and shining appearance
to an inferior tea by means of various colouring mixtures
or &#8220;facings,&#8221; which operation, while sometimes practised
upon black tea, is far more common with the green variety.
This adulteration involves the use of soap-stone, gypsum,
China clay, Prussian blue, indigo, turmeric, and graphite.
The author lately received from Japan several samples of
the preparations employed for facing the tea in that country,
the composition of which was shown by analysis to be
essentially as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ol><li>Magnesium silicate (soap-stone).</li>

<li>Calcium sulphate (gypsum).</li>

<li>Turmeric.</li>

<li>Indigo.</li>

<li>Ferric ferrocyanide (Prussian blue).</li>

<li>Soap-stone, 47&middot;5 per cent.; gypsum, 47&middot;5 per cent.; Prussian blue, 5 per cent.</li>

<li>Soap-stone, 45 per cent.; gypsum, 45 per cent.; Prussian blue, 10 per cent.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Soap-stone, 75 per cent.; indigo, 25 per cent.</li>

<li>Soap-stone, 60 per cent.; indigo, 40 per cent.</li></ol>

<p>The &#8220;facing&#8221; or &#8220;blooming&#8221; of tea is often accomplished
by simply placing it in an iron pan, heated by a fire, and
rapidly incorporating with it one of the preceding mixtures
(Nos. 6, 7, 8, or 9), in the proportion of about half a
dram to seven or eight pounds of the tea, a brisk stirring
being maintained until the desired shade of colour is produced.</p>

<p>Some of the above forms of sophistication usually go
together;&mdash;thus exhausted tea is restored by facing. The
collection of the spent leaves takes place in China. Much
of the facing was, until about three years since, done in New
York city, and constituted a regular branch of business,
which included among its operations such metamorphoses
as the conversion of a green tea into a black, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice

<p>The portion of ash insoluble in acids consisted of silica, clay, and
soapstone, indicating that the ash of tea dust is largely composed of
the mineral substances employed for &#8220;facing&#8221; purposes.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the ash of unspent tea are the presence
of manganic oxide, the large proportion of potassium salts present,
and the solubility of the ash in water. The amount of ash in genuine
tea ranges from five to six per cent. In the absence of exhausted
leaves, it has been found that the finer sorts of tea afford a smaller
proportion of ash than the inferior grades. It will be noticed that
spent tea ash exhibits a marked increase in the proportion of insoluble
compounds (silica, alumina, and ferric oxide), as well as a total
absence of potassium salts.</p>

<p>The presence of foreign leaves, and, in some instances, of mineral
adulterants in tea is best detected by means of a microscopical
examination of the suspected sample. The genuine tea-leaf is
characterised by its peculiar serrations and venations. Its border
exhibits serrations which stop a little short of the stalk, while the
venations extend from the central rib, nearly parallel to one another,
but turn just before reaching the border of the leaf.</p>

<p>Plate I. (Frontispiece) is a photogravure of a twig of the tea
plant, in possession of the author. The leaves are of natural size,
but the majority are of a greater maturity than those used in the
preparation of tea, which more resemble in size the few upper
leaves.</p>

<p>Plate II. shows more distinctly the serrations and venations
of the tea-leaf. The Chinese are said to occasionally employ ash,
camelia, and dog-rose leaves for admixture with tea, and the
product is stated to have formerly been subjected in England to the
addition of sloe, willow, beech, hawthorn, oak, etc. For scenting
purposes, chulan flowers, rose, jasmine, and orange leaves, have been
employed. The writer has lately received from Japan specimens of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> willow,
wisteria, <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">te-mo-ki</i>, and other leaves which at one time were used in
that country as admixtures.</p>

<p>Plate III. exhibits some of these leaves, two genuine Japan
tea-leaves being included for purpose of comparison. The leaves
represented in this plate are: 1, beech; 2, hawthorn; 3, rose; 4, Japan
tea; 5, willow; 6, <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">te-mo-ki</i>; 7, elm; 8, wisteria; 9, poplar. From
very recent reports of the American consuls in Japan and China, it
would appear that the addition of foreign leaves to tea is at present
but seldom resorted to, and this accords with the author&#8217;s
experience in the testing of the teas imported into this country.</p>

<p>In 1884, the Japanese Government made it a criminal offence to
adulterate tea, and instituted &#8220;tea guilds,&#8221; which are
governed by very stringent laws, and of which most dealers of repute
are members. The facing of tea does not appear, however, to have been
considered an adulteration, its continued practice being justified by
the plea that otherwise Japan teas would not suit the taste of American
consumers.</p>

<p>In the microscopic examination of tea, the sample should
be moistened with hot water and spread out on a glass
plate, and then submitted to a careful inspection, especial
attention being directed to the general outline of the leaf
and its serrations and venations. The presence of exhausted
tea-leaves may often be detected by their soft
texture and generally disintegrated appearance. If a
considerable quantity of the tea be placed in a long glass
cylinder and agitated with cold water, the colouring
and other abnormal substances frequently become detached,
and either rise to the surface of the liquid as a sort
of scum, or fall to the bottom as a sediment. In this way
Prussian blue, indigo, soapstone, gypsum, sand, and
turmeric can often be separated, and subsequently recognised
by their characteristic appearance under the microscope.
The separated substances should also be subjected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>to a chemical examination. Prussian blue is detected by
heating with a solution of sodium hydroxide, filtering,
acidulating the filtrate with acetic acid, and then adding
ferric chloride, when, in its presence, a blue colour will be
produced. Indigo is best recognised by the microscopic
examination. It is not decolorised by caustic alkali, but
it dissolves in sulphuric acid to a blue liquid. Soapstone,
gypsum, sand, and metallic iron, are identified by means of
the usual chemical reactions. A compound very aptly
termed &#8220;Lie-tea,&#8221; is sometimes met with. It forms little
pellets, consisting of tea-dust mixed with foreign leaves,
sand, etc., and held together by means of gum or starch.
This falls to powder if treated with boiling water. In the
presence of catechu, the tea infusion usually assumes a
muddy appearance upon standing. In case iron salts
have been employed to deepen the colour of the infusion,
they can be detected by treating the ground tea-leaves with
acetic acid, and testing the filtered solution with potassium
ferrocyanide. Tea should not turn black upon immersion
in hydrosulphuric acid water, nor should it impart a blue
colour to ammonia water. The infusion should be amber-coloured,
and not become reddened by the addition of an
acid.</p>

<p>The United States Tea Adulteration Act was passed by
Congress in 1883. The enactment of this law was largely
due to the exertions of prominent tea merchants, whose
business interests were seriously affected by the sale
(principally in trade auctions) of the debased or spurious
article. It is stated in the official report of the United
States Tea Examiner at New York City, that from March
1883 to December of the same year, 856,281 packages
(about four millions of pounds) of tea were inspected, of
which 7000 packages (325,000 pounds) were rejected as
unfit for consumption. Since the enforcement in New
York City of the Tea Adulteration Act, nearly 2000
samples of tea have been chemically tested under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
direction of the author. The proportion grossly adulterated
has been a little over nine per cent. But this does not
apply to the total amount imported, since only those
samples which were somewhat suspicious in appearance
were submitted for analysis. As the result of the past two
years&#8217; experience in the chemical examination of tea, the
prevailing adulterations were found to be of two kinds&mdash;the
admixture of spent tea-leaves, and the application
to the tea of a facing preparation. A natural green tea
possesses a dull hue, and is but seldom met with in the
trade; some Moyunes and uncoloured Japans (which
latter, properly speaking, is not a green tea) being almost
the only varieties not exhibiting the bright metallic lustre
due to the facing process. The addition of foreign leaves
was detected only in a few instances; the presence of sand
and gravel occurred far more frequently. Apropos of the
practical utility of Governmental sanitary legislation, it can
be stated that, since the enforcement of the Adulteration
Act, the tea imported into the city of New York has very
perceptibly improved in quality.</p>

<p>Attempts in tea culture are being made in the United
States of Columbia, S.A. A specimen of the prepared
plant received by the writer, differed greatly in appearance
from the Chinese and Japanese products. The leaves,
which had not been rolled but were quite flat, possessed
a light pea-green colour and a fine but rather faint aroma.
An examination indicated that the tea, although very
delicate in quality, was seriously deficient in body.</p>

<p>The following Tea Assay, while not including the determinations
of all the proximate constituents of the plant, will,
it is believed, in most instances suffice to indicate to the
analyst the presence of spent leaves, mineral colouring
matters, and other inorganic adulterations.</p>

<p><i>Theine</i> (<i>Caffeine</i>), C<span class="sub">8</span>H<span class="sub">10</span>N<span class="sub">4</span>O<span class="sub">2</span>.&mdash;Contrary to the once
general belief, there does not always exist a direct relation
between the quality of tea (at least so far as this is indicated
by its market price) and the proportion of theine contained,
although the physiological value of the plant is doubtless
due to the presence of this alkaloid.</p>

<p>The commercial tea-taster is almost entirely guided in
his judgment in regard to the value of a sample of tea by
the age of the leaf, and by the flavour or bouquet produced
upon &#8220;drawing,&#8221; and this latter quality is to be mainly
ascribed to the volatile oil.</p>

<p>The following process will serve for the estimation of
theine:&mdash;A weighed quantity of the tea is boiled with
distilled water until the filtered infusion ceases to exhibit
any colour. The filtrate is evaporated on a water bath to
the consistence of a syrup; it is next mixed with calcined
magnesia to alkaline reaction, and carefully evaporated to
dryness.</p>

<p>The residue obtained is then finely powdered, digested
for a day or so with ether (or chloroform) and filtered, the
remaining undissolved matter being again digested with a
fresh quantity of ether, so long as any further solution of
theine takes place. The ether is now removed from the
united filtrates by distillation, whereupon the theine will be
obtained in a fairly pure condition.</p>

<p>Theine contains a very large proportion of nitrogen
(almost 29 per cent.), and Wanklyn<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has suggested the
application of his ammonia process (see p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>) to the
analysis of tea. Genuine tea is stated to yield from 0&middot;7 to
0&middot;8 per cent. of total ammonia, when tested in this manner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Volatile Oil.</i>&mdash;Ten grammes of the tea are distilled with
water; the distillate is filtered, saturated with calcium
chloride, then well agitated with ether, and allowed to remain
at rest for some time. The ethereal solution is subsequently
drawn off, and spontaneously evaporated in a
weighed capsule. The increase in weight gives approximately
the amount of oil present. A sample of good black
tea yielded by this method 0&middot;87 per cent. of volatile oil.</p>

<p><i>Tannin.</i>&mdash;Two grammes of the well-averaged sample are
boiled with 100 c.c. of water, for about an hour, and the infusion
filtered, the undissolved matter remaining upon the
filter being thoroughly washed with hot water, and the
washings added to the solution first obtained. If necessary,
the liquid is next reduced to a volume of 100 c.c. by evaporation
over a water-bath. It is then heated to boiling, and
25 c.c. of a solution of cupric acetate added. The copper
solution is prepared by dissolving five grammes of the salt
in 100 c.c. of water, and filtering. The precipitate formed
is separated by filtration, well washed, dried, and ignited in
a porcelain crucible. A little nitric acid is then added and
the ignition repeated. One gramme of the cupric oxide
thus obtained represents 1&middot;305 grammes of tannin. For
the estimation of spent leaves (especially in black tea), Mr.
Allen suggests the following formula, in which E represents
the percentage of spent tea, and T the percentage of tannin
found:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">E = <span class="division">
<span class="numerator">(10 - T) 100</span>
<span class="denominator">8</span></span>.</p>

<p><i>The Ash.</i>&mdash;<i>a. Total Ash.</i>&mdash;Five grammes of the sample are
placed in a platinum dish and ignited over a Bunsen burner
until complete incineration is accomplished. The vessel is
allowed to cool in a desiccator, and is then quickly weighed.
In genuine tea the total ash should not be much below
5 per cent., nor much above 6 per cent., and it should not be
magnetic. In faced teas the proportion of total ash is sometimes
10 per cent.; in &#8220;lie-tea&#8221; it may reach 30 per cent.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
while in spent tea it frequently falls below 3 per cent., the
ash in this case being abnormally rich in lime salts, and
poor in potassium salts.</p>

<p><i>b. Ash insoluble in water.</i>&mdash;The total ash obtained in <i>a</i> is
washed into a beaker, and boiled with water for a considerable time. It
is then brought upon a filter, washed, dried, ignited, and weighed. In
unadulterated tea it rarely exceeds 3 per cent. of the sample taken.</p>

<p><i>c. Ash soluble in water.</i>&mdash;This proportion is obtained by
deducting the ash insoluble in water from the total ash. Genuine tea
contains from 3 per cent. to 3&middot;5 per cent. of soluble ash, or at least
50 per cent. of the total ash, whereas in exhausted tea the amount is
often but 0&middot;5 per cent. The following formula has been proposed for the
calculation of the percentage of spent tea E, where S is the percentage
of soluble ash obtained:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">E = (6 - 2S) 20.</p>

<p>A sample prepared by averaging several good grades of black tea, was
mixed with an equal quantity of exhausted tea-leaves. The proportion
of soluble ash in the mixture was found to be 1&middot;8 per cent. According
to the above formula, the spent tea present would be 48 per cent., or
within 2 per cent. of the actual amount.</p>

<p><i>d. Ash insoluble in acid.</i>&mdash;The ash insoluble in water is
boiled with dilute hydrochloric acid, and the residue separated by
filtration, washed, ignited, and weighed. In pure tea, the remaining
ash ranges between 0&middot;3 and 0&middot;8 per cent.; in faced tea, or in tea
adulterated by the addition of sand, etc., it may reach the proportion
of 2 to 5 per cent. Fragments of silica and brickdust are occasionally
found in the ash insoluble in acid.</p>

<p><i>The Extract.</i>&mdash;Two grammes of the <em>carefully sampled</em> tea are
boiled with water until all soluble matter is dissolved, more water
being added from time to time to prevent the solution becoming too
concentrated. The operation may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> also be conducted in a flask connected
with an ascending Liebig&#8217;s condenser. In either case, the
infusion obtained is poured upon a tared filter, and the remaining
insoluble leaf repeatedly washed with hot water so long as the filtered
liquor shows a colour. The filtrate is now diluted to a volume of 200
c.c., and of this 50 c.c. are taken and evaporated in a weighed dish
until the weight of the extract remains constant. Genuine tea affords
from 32 to 50 per cent. of extract, according to its age and quality;
in spent tea the proportion of extract will naturally be greatly
reduced. Mr. Allen employs the formula below for determining the
percentage of spent tea E in a sample, R representing the percentage of
extract found.</p>

<p class="center">E = <span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">(32 - R) 100</span>
  <span class="denominator">30</span></span>.</p>

<p>In order to test the practical value of this equation, a sample
of black tea was mixed with 50 per cent. of spent tea-leaves, and a
determination made of the extract afforded. The calculated proportion
of spent tea was 44 per cent., instead of 50 per cent. It should be
added, however, that the tea taken subsequently proved to be of a very
superior quality, yielding an extract of 40 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Gum (Dextrine).</i>&mdash;The proportion of gum contained in genuine
tea is usually inconsiderable. Its separation is effected by treating
the concentrated extract with alcohol, allowing the mixture to stand
at rest for a few hours, and collecting the precipitated gum upon
a tared filter, and carefully drying and weighing it. As a certain
amount of mineral matter is generally present in the precipitate, this
should afterwards be incinerated and a deduction made for the ash thus
obtained. A more satisfactory method is to treat the separated dextrine
with very dilute sulphuric acid, and estimate the amount of glucose
formed by means of Fehling&#8217;s solution (see p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>); 100 parts of
glucose are equivalent to 90 parts of dextrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Insoluble Leaf.</i>&mdash;The insoluble leaf as obtained in the
determination of the extract, together with the weighed filter,
is placed in an air-bath, and dried for at least eight hours at a
temperature of 100&#176;,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and then weighed. In
genuine tea the amount of insoluble leaf ranges from 47 to 54 per
cent.; in exhausted tea it may reach a proportion of 75 per cent. or
more. It should be noted that in the foregoing estimations the tea is
taken in its ordinary air-dried condition. If it be desired to reduce
the results obtained to a dry basis, an allowance for the moisture
present in the sample (an average of 6 to 8 per cent.), or a direct
determination of the same must be made.</p>

<p>The following tabulation gives the constituents of genuine tea, so
far as the ash, extract, and insoluble leaf are involved:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Total ash</i> ranges between 4&middot;7 and 6&middot;2 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Ash soluble in water</i> ranges between 3 and 3&middot;5 per cent.; should
equal 50 per cent. of total ash.</p>

<p><i>Ash insoluble in water</i>, not over 3 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Ash insoluble in acid</i> ranges between 0&middot;3 and 0&middot;8 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Extract</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ranges between 32 and 50
per cent.</p>

<p><i>Insoluble leaf</i> ranges between 43 and 58 per cent.</p>

<p>The table below may prove useful as indicating the requirements to
be exacted when the chemist is asked to give an opinion concerning the
presence of facing admixtures, or of exhausted or foreign leaves in a
sample of tea.</p>

<p><i>Total ash</i> should not be under 4&middot;5 per cent. or above 7 per
cent.</p>

<p><i>Ash soluble in water</i> should not be under 40 per cent. of total
ash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ash insoluble in water</i> should not be over 3&middot;25 per
cent.</p>

<p><i>Ash insoluble in acid</i> should not be over 1 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Extract</i> (excepting in poor varieties of Congou tea) should not be
under 30 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Insoluble Leaf</i> should not be over 60 per cent.</p>

<p>The British Society of Public Analysts adopt:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Total ash</i> (dry basis), not over 8 per cent. (at least 3 per cent.
should be soluble in water).</p>

<p><i>Extract</i> (tea as sold), not under 30 per cent.</p>

and extract found in 850 samples of tea (mostly inferior and

<h2>COFFEE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Coffee</span> is the seed of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caffea
Arabica</i>, indigenous to Abyssinia and southern Arabia, and since
naturalised in the West Indies, Ceylon, Brazil, and other tropical
countries. Its importance as an almost universal beverage is only
equalled by that of tea. The ancient history of coffee is shrouded in
great obscurity. It was unknown to the Romans and Greeks, but its use
is said to have been prevalent in Abyssinia from the remotest time,
and in Arabia it formed an article of general consumption during the
fifteenth century. From its introduction, in 1575, into Constantinople
by the Turks, it gradually made its way into all civilised countries.
In 1690 it was carried by the Dutch from Mocha to Java, whence
specimens of the tree were taken to Holland and France. Coffee houses
were opened in London about the middle of the seventeenth century,
and in 1809 the first cargo of coffee was shipped to the United
States. As with many other articles of diet, the adulteration of
coffee has kept well apace with its increased consumption. The bean is
deprived of its external fleshy coatings before exportation, and is
met with in commerce in a raw, roasted, or ground condition. Bell<a

<p>It will be noticed from these analyses that the amount of sugar
is greatly diminished by the process of roasting. According to some
analysts, the proportion of fat experiences an increase, but it is more
probable that this constituent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> is simply rendered more susceptible to the
action of solvents by a mechanical alteration of the structure of the
berry. Recent determinations of the ash in coffee place its average
proportion at 4 per cent.; 3&middot;24 being soluble in water, and 0&middot;74 per
cent. insoluble. The soluble extract in roasted coffee usually amounts
to about 30 per cent.</p>

<p>The most common adulterations to which coffee is liable consist
in the addition of chicory, caramel, and numerous roasted grains,
such as corn, wheat, and rye, as well as such roots and seeds as
dandelion, mangold wurzel, turnips, beans, peas, etc. The roasted and
ground article is naturally most exposed to falsification, although
letters patent have been issued for the fictitious manufacture of a
pressed &#8220;coffee bean,&#8221; containing absolutely no coffee.
The addition of chicory is by far the most prevalent adulteration of
coffee. Of thirty-four samples examined by Hassall, thirty-one (91
per cent.) contained this root. In regard to the moral aspects of its
use, it can safely be asserted that, while the addition of chicory
to coffee is largely sanctioned, and indeed demanded by the existing
tastes of many coffee-drinkers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> its use constitutes a true adulteration,
and should be condemned, unless its presence is prominently stated
on the label of the package. In chicory the active principles of
coffee, which exert valuable physiological effects on the system (viz.
caffeine, the essential oil, etc.), are totally absent; moreover, its
comparative cheapness is a constant temptation to employ a proportion
largely in excess of the amount requisite to produce any alleged
improvement in the flavour of the resulting admixture.</p>

<p>The sophistications of coffee may be detected, in a general way, by
physical tests, by chemical analysis, and by microscopic examination,
in which processes great aid is derived from the characteristic
properties exhibited by the pure roasted and ground berry which
distinguish it from its more usual adulterants.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Physical Examination.</i>&mdash;The following tests, while not
always decisive in their results, are often of service.</p>

<p>A small portion of the suspected sample is gently placed upon the
surface of a beaker filled with cold water, and allowed to remain at
rest for about fifteen minutes. If pure, the sample does not imbibe the
water, but floats upon the surface without communicating much colour to
it; if chicory or caramel be present, these substances rapidly absorb
moisture and sink, producing brownish-red streaks in their descent,
which, by diffusion, impart a very decided tint to the entire liquid. A
similar coloration is caused by many other roasted roots and berries,
but not so quickly or to so great an extent. The test may be somewhat
modified by shaking the sample with cold water, and then allowing
the vessel to stand aside for a short time. Pure coffee rises to the
surface, little or no colour being imparted to the water; chicory,
etc., fall to the bottom as a sediment, and give a brownish colour to
the liquid.</p>

<p>If a small quantity of the sample is placed upon a clean plate
of glass, and moistened with a few drops of water, the pure coffee
berries remain hard, and offer resistance<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> when tested with a needle;
most grains employed for their adulteration become softened in their
texture.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the mixture is treated with boiling water
and allowed to settle. Genuine coffee affords a clear and limpid
infusion; many foreign grains yield a thick gummy liquor, resulting
from the starchy and saccharine matters contained. An infusion of pure
coffee, if treated with solution of cupric acetate and filtered, will
show a greenish-yellow colour; if chicory be present, the filtrate will
be reddish-brown. As a rule, samples of ground coffee which are much
adulterated, pack together when subjected to a moderate pressure.</p>

<p>Owing to the low density of a coffee infusion (due to its almost
entire freedom from sugar), as compared with that of the infusions
of most roots and grains, it has been suggested by Messrs. Graham,
Stenhouse and Campbell, to apply the specific gravity determination
of the infusion obtained from the suspected sample as a means for
detecting adulteration. The results afforded are fairly approximate.
The solution is prepared by boiling one part of the sample with ten
parts of water and filtering. The following table gives the densities,
at 15&#176;&middot;5, of various infusions made in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Assuming the gravity of the pure coffee infusion to be 1&middot;0086, and
that of chicory to be 1&middot;0206, the approximate percentage of coffee, C,
in a mixture, can be obtained by means of the following equation, in
which D represents the density of the infusion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
  C = <span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">1&middot;00(1&middot;020 - D)</span>

</p>

<p>This was tested by mixing equal parts of coffee and
chicory, and taking the specific gravity of the infusion;
it was 1&middot;01408, indicating the presence of 49 per cent. of
coffee. Some idea of the amount of foreign admixture
(especially chicory) in ground roasted coffee may be formed
from the tinctorial power of the sample. It has already
been mentioned that coffee imparts much less colour to
water than do most roasted grains and roots. The table

<p>The comparative colour test may also be applied as follows:<a
name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;One gramme each of the sample under
examination, and of a sample prepared by mixing equal parts of pure
coffee and chicory, are completely exhausted with water, and the
infusions made up to 100 c.c. or more; 50 c.c. of the filtered extract
from the suspected sample are then placed in a Nessler cylinder, and it
is determined by trial how many c.c. of the extract from the standard
mixture, together with enough distilled water to make up the 50 c.c.,
will produce the same colour. In calculating the chicory present, it is
assumed that this substance possesses three times the tinctorial power
of coffee.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Chemical Examination.</i>&mdash;Some of the chemical properties
of roasted coffee afford fairly reliable means for the detection of an
admixture of chicory. Coffee ash dissolves in water to the extent of
about 80 per cent.; of the ash of roasted chicory only about 35 per
cent. is soluble. Coffee ash is almost free from silica and sand, which
substances form a notable proportion of the constituents of the ash of
chicory.</p>

<p>The following (see p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>) are the results obtained by the writer
from the analysis of the ash of coffee and chicory.</p>

<p>It will be observed from these analyses, that the most distinctive
features presented by coffee ash are the absence of soda, and the
small amounts of chlorine, ferric oxide and silica present. In
these respects, it is very different from the ash of chicory. The
proportion of phosphoric acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36"
id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> found in the latter is in excess of that
given by some authorities. Several analyses of chicory ash have been
made by the author, and, in every instance, the amount of phosphoric
acid was over 8 per cent.; in one sample of the ash of commercial
chicory it approximated 13 per cent.</p>

<p>The following formula has been suggested for determining the

C = 2 <span class="division">

<p>where S represents the percentage of soluble ash.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy difference between roasted coffee and chicory, is
the amount of sugar contained. As a rule, in roasted coffee, it ranges
from 0&middot;0 to 1&middot;2 per cent.; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> roasted chicory, it varies from 12&middot; to
18&middot; per cent. The quantity of sugar in a sample can be determined by
Fehling&#8217;s method as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A standard solution of pure cupric sulphate is first prepared by
dissolving 34&middot;64 grammes of the crystals (previously ground and dried
by pressing between bibulous paper) in about 200 c.c. of distilled
water; 173 grammes of pure Rochelle salt are separately dissolved
in 480 c.c. of a solution of sodium hydroxide of sp. gr. 1&middot;14. The
solutions are then mixed and diluted with distilled water to one litre.
Each c.c. of the above solution represents 0&middot;05 gramme of grape sugar.
The test is applied by taking 10 c.c. of the copper solution, adding
about four times its volume of water, and bringing it to the boiling
point. The coffee infusion is then gradually added from a burette,
until the copper salt is completely reduced to the red sub-oxide,
which point is recognised by the disappearance of its blue colour, and
can be more accurately determined by acidulating the filtered fluid
with acetic acid and testing it (while still hot) for any remaining
trace of copper with potassium ferrocyanide. In preparing the coffee
solution for the foregoing test, it is advisable to exhaust a weighed
quantity of the sample with hot water. The infusion is treated with
basic plumbic acetate so long as a precipitate forms; it is then
filtered, the precipitate being well washed, and the lead contained
is removed by conducting sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the fluid
which is subsequently again filtered and boiled until the dissolved gas
is expelled. The sugar determination is now made. Wanklyn employs the
following equation to estimate the amount of chicory in an adulterated
sample:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
E = <span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">(S - 1)100</span>
  <span class="denominator">14</span></span>,
</p>

<p>where E is the percentage of chicory, and S the percentage
of sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the analysis of K&#246;nig, the proportions of sugar
and other constituents in some of the adulterants of coffee, are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The presence of roasted rye, corn, and other grains in coffee,
may be qualitatively recognised by testing the cold infusion of the
sample with iodine solution for starch, which<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> is not contained in a ready
formed state in coffee. Caffeine is absent in chicory and the other
usual adulterants of coffee, and the estimation of this alkaloid is of
decided service (see p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>). Roasted coffee contains about 1 per cent.
of caffeine.</p>

<p>A popular brand of ground coffee received by the author for

<p>The raw coffee bean is sometimes subjected to a process termed
&#8220;sweating,&#8221; which consists in treating it with moist steam,
the object being to artificially reproduce the conditions present in
the holds of vessels, by means of which the bean is increased in size,
and also somewhat improved in colour and flavour. Another form of
manipulation, analogous to the facing of tea, is to moisten the raw
bean with water containing a little gum, and agitate it with various
pigments, such as indigo, Prussian blue, Persian berries, turmeric,
alkanet, Venetian red, soap-stone, chrome-yellow, and iron ochre.
Mexican coffees are sometimes made to resemble the more expensive
Java in appearance. The chemist of the New York City Board of Health
has found in the quantity of such treated coffee commonly taken to
make a cup of the beverage 0&middot;0014 gramme of cupric arsenite. Indigo
may be detected in the artificially coloured product by treating a
considerable portion of the sample with dilute nitric acid, filtering
and saturating the filtrate with sulphuretted hydrogen. If indigo be
present, it can now be extracted upon agitating the solution with
chloroform. Alkanet root and Prussian blue are separated by warming the
coffee with solution of potassium carbonate, from which these pigments
are precipitated upon addition of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Microscopic Examination.</i>&mdash;Great aid to the chemical
investigation is afforded by the microscopic examination of ground
coffee. It is necessary to first become familiar with the appearance
of the genuine article&mdash;low magnifying<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> powers being
employed&mdash;and then make comparative examinations of the adulterant
suspected to be present.</p>

<p>The coffee bean mainly consists of irregular cells inclosed in very
thick walls which are distinguished by uneven projections. The cells
contain globules of oil. Most of the roots added to coffee exhibit
a conglomeration of cells (provided with thin walls) and groups of
jointed tubes, often quite similar to one another in structure. The
microscopic appearance of some of the starch granules, occasionally met
with in coffee mixtures, is represented on p. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>.</p>

<p>Of 151 samples of ground coffee recently purchased at random and
tested by various American chemists, 69 (45&middot;7 per cent.) were found to
be adulterated.</p>

<h2>COCOA AND CHOCOLATE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cocoa</span> is prepared from the roasted seeds
of the tree <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theobroma cacao</i>, of the order <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Byttneriace&aelig;</i>. It
sometimes appears in commerce as &#8220;cocoa-nibs&#8221; (<i>i. e.</i>
partially ground), but it is more frequently sold in the powdered
state, either pure or mixed with sugar and starch, and also often
deprived of about one-half of its fat. Chocolate usually consists of
cocoa-paste and sugar flavoured with vanilla, cinnamon, or cloves, and
commonly mixed with flour or starch. According to Wanklyn, the average
composition of cocoa is as follows:&mdash;</p>

great solubility, the small amounts of chlorine, carbonates, and soda,
and the constancy of the proportion of phosphoric acid contained. Bell

<p>The comparatively low percentage of ash contained in prepared cocoas
and chocolate, is of use in indicating the amount of real cocoa present
in such mixtures. A large proportion of the mineral constituents of
cocoa are dissolved by directly treating it with cold water. Wanklyn
obtained in this way from genuine cocoa-nibs 6&middot;76 per cent. organic
matter, and 2&middot;16 per cent. ash, the latter chiefly consisting of
phosphates; a commercial cocoa gave, extract, 46&middot;04 per cent.; ash,
1&middot;04 per cent. The most common admixtures of cocoa and chocolate,
are sugar and the various starches. The addition of foreign fats,
chicory, and iron ochres, is also sometimes practised. Since prepared
cocoas are generally understood to contain the first-named diluents,
their presence can hardly be considered an adulteration, if the fact
is mentioned upon the packages. Many varieties of the cocoas of
commerce will be found to be deficient in cocoa-butter, a considerable
proportion of which has been removed in the process of manufacture.
This practice is also claimed to be justifiable, the object being to
produce an article unobjectionable to invalids, which is not always
the case with pure cocoa. In the analysis of cocoa the following
estimations are usually made:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Theobromine.</i>&mdash;10 grammes of the sample are first repeatedly
exhausted with petroleum-naphtha. The insoluble residue is mixed with a
small quantity of paste, prepared by triturating calcined magnesia with
a little water, and the mixture evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat.
The second residue is boiled with alcohol and the alcoholic solution of
theobromine filtered and evaporated to dryness in a tared capsule. It
is then purified by washing with petroleum-naphtha and weighed. Bell
has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
verified the existence in cocoa of a second alkaloid, distinct from
theobromine, which crystallises in silky needles very similar to
theine.</p>

<p><i>Fat.</i>&mdash;The proportion of fat is readily determined by
evaporating to dryness the petroleum-naphtha used in the preceding
estimation. As already stated, it is generally present in a proportion
of 50 per cent. in pure cocoa; the amount contained in prepared soluble
cocoas being often less than 25 per cent. The English minimum standard
is 20 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i>&mdash;The ash is determined by the incineration of a weighed
portion of the sample in a platinum dish. In prepared cocoas and
chocolates, the proportion of ash is considerably lower than in pure
cocoa. It is of importance to ascertain the amount of ash soluble in
water (the proportion in genuine cocoa is about 50 per cent.), and
especially the quantity of phosphoric acid contained. Assuming that
prepared cocoa contains 1&middot;5 per cent. of ash, of which 0&middot;6 per cent.
consists of phosphoric acid, and allowing that pure cocoa contains 0&middot;9
per cent. of phosphoric acid, Blyth adopts the following formula for
calculating the proportion of cocoa present in the article:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">&middot;6 &#215; 100</span>
  <span class="denominator">&middot;9</span></span> = 66&middot;66 per cent.
</p>

<p><i>Starch.</i>&mdash;A convenient method for estimating the starch is
to first remove the fatty matter of the cocoa by exhaustion with
petroleum-naphtha, and then boil the residue with alcohol. The
remaining insoluble matter is dried, and afterwards boiled until the
starch becomes soluble. It is next again boiled for several hours
with a little dilute sulphuric acid, after which the solution is
purified by addition of basic plumbic acetate. The liquid is then
treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, in order to remove the lead,
and the sugar contained in the filtered solution is determined by
means of Fehling&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> solution, and calculated to terms of
starch. The proportion of starch normally present in cocoa is to
be deducted from the results thus afforded. The variety of starch
contained in cocoa differs in its microscopic appearance from the
starches most frequently added.</p>

<p><i>Sugar.</i>&mdash;The sugar may be determined by evaporating the
alcoholic solution obtained in the preceding process, and then
subjecting the residue to the same method of procedure.</p>

<p>The proportion of woody fibre in cocoa can be approximately
estimated by the method of Henneberg and Stohman,<a
name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which consists in extracting the fat with
benzole, boiling the remaining substances for half an hour, first with
1&middot;25 per cent. sulphuric acid, then with 1&middot;25 per cent. solution of
potassium hydroxide. The residue is washed with alcohol and with ether,
and its weight determined. Unwashed cocoa-berries, when treated in this
manner, gave from 2 to 3 per cent. of cellulose, while cocoa husks
furnished from 10 to 16 per cent. The presence of chicory in soluble
cocoa and chocolate is easily recognised by the dark colour of the
extract obtained, upon digesting the suspected sample with cold water;
ochres and other colouring matters are detected by the reddish colour
of the ash as well as by its abnormal composition. The addition of
foreign fats to chocolates is stated to be occasionally resorted to.</p>

<p>The melting point of pure cocoa-butter varies from 30&#176; to 33&#176;. The
identification of foreign fats can sometimes be accomplished by means
of their higher melting point, and by an examination of the separated
fat, according to Koettstorfer&#8217;s method (see p. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>). The table
following gives the melting points of various fats, and the number of
milligrammes of K(OH) required for the saponification of one gramme of
the same.</p>

<p>Other tests have also been suggested for the detection of foreign
fats in cocoa-butter:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Treat the fat with two parts of cold ether; pure cocoa-butter
dissolves, forming a clear solution, whereas in presence of tallow or
wax a cloudy mixture is obtained.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Dissolve 10 grammes of the suspected fat in benzole, and
expose the solution to a temperature of 0&#176;. By this treatment a
separation of pure cocoa-butter in minute grains is produced. The
liquid is now heated to 14&#176;&middot;4, when the cocoa-fat will re-dissolve to a
transparent solution, while the presence of tallow will be recognised
by the turbid appearance of the liquid.</p>

<h2>MILK.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to the very important sanitary
relations of milk as a model food, the subject of its sophistication
has during the past ten years received particular notice at the
hands of the food-chemist. The investigations of our public sanitary
authorities have shown that milk adulteration is exceedingly common.
It is stated upon good authority that until quite recently (1883) the
120 millions of quarts of milk annually brought into New York city
were intentionally diluted with 40 millions of quarts of water, the
resulting product rivalling in richness the famous compound once lauded
by the philanthropic Squeers.</p>

<p>The results of the examination of milk instituted by the New York
State Board of Health are given below, in which, however, the specimens
of skimmed milk are not included:&mdash;</p>

<p>From October 1883 to March 1884, of 241 samples of milk examined
by the Public Analyst of Eastern Massachusetts, 21&middot;37 per cent.
were watered; of 1190 samples tested during the year 1884, 790
were watered.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Over 73 per cent.
of the milk supplied to the city of Buffalo in 1885 was found to
be adulterated. A very marked improvement<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> in the quality of the milk
received in New York city has taken place since the appointment of a
State Dairy Commissioner (1884). Under the direction of this official
the metropolitan milk supply has been subjected to a most rigid
inspection, and with very satisfactory results. During the years 1884
and 1885 nearly 45,000 samples of milk were examined.</p>

<p>A very common sophistication practised upon milk consists in the
partial or complete removal of its cream. This process of skimming is
conducted at establishments called &#8220;creameries,&#8221; of which
sixty-three were formerly known to send their impoverished product to
New York city. The State Dairy Commissioner has likewise accomplished
much towards stopping this form of adulteration.</p>

<p>Milk is the secretion of the mammary glands of female <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mammalia</i>.
It is an opaque liquid, possessing a white, bluish-white, or
yellowish-white colour, little or no odour, and a somewhat sweetish
taste. At times it exhibits an amphigenic reaction, <i>i. e.</i> it turns
red litmus blue and blue litmus red. From the examination of nearly one
thousand cows in the States of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut,
the <em>minimum</em> specific gravity of milk was found to be 1&middot;0290, the
<em>maximum</em> being 1&middot;0394. The opacity of milk is only apparent, and is
due to the presence of fatty globules held in suspension; these under
the microscope are seen to be surrounded by a transparent liquid.
Upon allowing milk to remain at rest for some time it experiences
two changes. At first, a yellowish-white stratum of cream rises to
the surface, the lower portion becoming bluish-white in colour and
increasing in density. If this latter is freed from the cream and
again set aside, it undergoes a further separation into a solid
body (<em>curd</em>), and a liquid (<em>whey</em>). This coagulation of the curd
(<em>caseine</em>) is immediately produced by the addition of rennet, and of
many acids and metallic salts.</p>

<p>The essential ingredients of milk are water, fat, caseine,
sugar (lactose), and inorganic salts. The following table,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

<p>The principal adulterations of milk (watering and skimming), are
detected by taking its specific gravity, and making quantitative
determinations of the total milk solids, the fat, and the milk solids
not fat. Of these criteria, the last-mentioned is the most constant and
reliable.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Physical Examination.</i></p>

<p><i>a. Specific Gravity.</i>&mdash;The instrument employed by the New York
health inspectors for testing milk is a variety of the hydrometer,
termed the lactometer, and its use, which is based upon the fact that
under ordinary conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> watered milk possesses a decreased
density, is certainly of great value as a preliminary test. The Board
of Health lactometer indicates specific gravities between 1&middot;000 (the
density of water) and 1&middot;0348. On its scale 100&#176; represents the specific
gravity of 1&middot;029 (taken as the minimum density of genuine milk), and 0
represents the density of water; the graduations are extended to 120&#176;,
equivalent to a specific gravity of 1&middot;0348. In taking an observation
with the lactometer, the standard temperature of 15&#176; should be
obtained, <em>and the colour and consistency of the milk noted</em>. If these
latter properties indicate a dilution of the sample, and the instrument
sinks below the 100&#176; mark, it is safe to assume that the milk has been
watered. The scale is so constructed that the extent of the dilution
is directly shown by the reading, <i>e. g.</i> if the lactometer sinks to
70&#176; the sample contains 70 per cent. of pure milk and 30 per cent.
of water. As the standard of specific gravity (1&middot;029) selected for
the 100&#176; mark of the lactometer is the <em>minimum</em> density of unwatered
milk, it is evident that the readings of the instrument will almost
invariably indicate an addition of water less than has actually taken
place. It would therefore appear that, under normal circumstances,
the standard adopted by the New York Board of Health errs on the side
of too much leniency toward the milk dealer. Cream being lighter than
water, a sample of skimmed milk will possess a greater specific gravity
than the pure article, and it is possible to add from 10 to 20 per
cent. of water to it and still have the resulting admixture stand at
100&#176; when tested by the lactometer. Vehement attempts have been made in
court and elsewhere to impeach the accuracy of the indications afforded
by the lactometer. These have been mainly founded upon the fact that
a sample of milk unusually rich in cream will have a lower density
than a poorer grade, so that it is quite possible that milk of very
superior quality may show a gravity identical with that of a watered
specimen. Great stress has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> laid upon this by the opponents of the
measures to control milk adulteration adopted by the public sanitary
authorities. They have contended that a chemical analysis should be
made. Recourse to this method would, however, involve a greater amount
of time than it is usually practicable to devote to the examination
of the numerous samples daily inspected; moreover, the process is
resorted to whenever the indications of the lactometer leave the
inspector in doubt. With the exercise of ordinary intelligence this
contingency seldom arises, as the proportion of cream required to
reduce the specific gravity to that of a watered sample would be more
than sufficient to obviate any danger of mistaking the cause of the
decreased density. In this connection it should be stated, that the
average lactometric standing of about 20,000 samples of milk, examined
by the New York State Dairy Commissioner in the year 1884, was 110&#176;,
equivalent to a specific gravity of 1&middot;0319.</p>

<p><i>b. Water, Total Solids, and Ash.</i>&mdash;Five grammes of the fresh
milk are weighed in a tared platinum dish, having a flat bottom, which
is placed on a water-bath, where it is allowed to remain for about
three hours. It is then transferred to a water-oven, and the dish is
subsequently weighed, from time to time, until the weight becomes
constant. The loss in weight is the <em>water</em> present; the difference
between the weight of the platinum capsule and its weight with the
remaining contents gives the amount of <em>total solids</em>, which, in milk
of good quality, should not be under 12 per cent. The inorganic salts
(ash) can now be determined by carefully incinerating the residual
contents of the capsule. Too high a temperature is to be avoided
in this process, in order to prevent the fusion of the ash,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> which
should, however, be ignited until it shows a greyish-white colour. The
amount of ash in genuine milk ranges from 0&middot;70 to 0&middot;80 per cent. The
addition of water naturally decreases this proportion as well as that
of the total milk-solids.</p>

<p><i>c. Fat, Milk Solids not Fat, Caseine, and Milk Sugar.</i>&mdash;An
approximate estimation of the fat in milk was formerly made by the
use of the <em>creamometer</em>. This instrument consists simply of a long
glass tube, provided at its upper end with a scale. The milk under
examination is introduced into the tube and allowed to remain at rest
for about 24 hours, or until the stratum of cream has completely
collected upon its surface; the quantity is then read off by means
of the attached scale. The results afforded by the creamometer are,
however, far from reliable. Cream is really milk rich in fat, caseine,
etc., and the quantitative relation it bears to the true amount of fat
present is not always a direct one. A recent form of <em>lactoscope</em>,
devised by Feser, is less objectionable, and is in very general use
for the rapid estimation of fat in milk. It consists essentially of
a glass cylinder, provided with two scales, one being graduated into
c.c., the other, into percentages of fat. In the lower end of the
instrument is a contraction, in which is placed a cylindrical piece
of white glass, graduated with well-defined black lines. In using the
lactoscope, 4 c.c. of the milk are introduced into the instrument by
means of a pipette, and water is gradually added, with shaking, until
the black marks on the small white cylinder become just visible.
Upon now referring to the c.c. scale, the quantity of water used to
effect the necessary dilution is ascertained, and the corresponding
percentage of fat in the sample is indicated by the percentage scale.<a
name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In the gravimetric determination of the fat (butter), 10 grammes
of the milk are put into a tared platinum dish, containing a weighed
amount of dry sand. The milk is evaporated as previously directed,
the mixture being constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> stirred with a small platinum spatula.
The residue is repeatedly treated with warm ether or petroleum naphtha
of 70&#176; B., and the solutions poured upon a small filter. The several
filtrates are collected in a tared beaker, and cautiously evaporated,
until constant weight is obtained. This will give the amount of
<em>fat</em>. The undissolved residue remaining in the platinum capsule,
or the difference between the quantity of fat and that of the total
milk-solids, affords the proportion of <em>milk solids not fat</em> contained,
which, in unadulterated milk, should amount to 9 per cent. It has been
determined by experiment, that every percentage of milk-solids not fat,
increases the specific gravity of milk 0&middot;00375, whereas each percentage
of fat decreases the gravity 0&middot;0010, and the proportion of solids not
fat can be calculated from the data afforded by the lactometer and
Feser&#8217;s lactoscope by means of the formula:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">(S - A)</span>
  <span class="denominator">0&middot;00375</span>
</span>,
</p>

<p>where S is the specific gravity of the milk, as shown by the
lactometer, and A is the remainder obtained upon multiplying the
percentage of fat indicated by the lactoscope by 0&middot;001 and subtracting
the residue from 1&middot;0000.</p>

<p>The residue remaining after the extraction of the fat is treated
with warm water containing a few drops of acetic acid, or with dilute
(80 per cent.) alcohol, in order to remove the sugar. The residue is
dried until it ceases to decrease in weight, and is then weighed. The
difference between the original weight of the sand and the weight of
the sand and residue combined represents approximately the amount
of <em>caseine</em> (albuminoids) present. As this contains a certain
proportion of ash it is to be subsequently ignited, and the ash
obtained deducted from the first weight. The alcoholic sugar solution
is evaporated to dryness and weighed. The residue is then incinerated
and the weight of ash is subtracted. The difference is the amount of
<em>milk sugar</em> contained. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> sugar may likewise be determined by means
of Fehling&#8217;s solution (see pp. 37, 111). About 50 c.c. of the
milk is warmed with a small quantity of acetic acid to precipitate
the caseine, which is removed by filtration, and the filtrate diluted
to 500 c.c.; the test is then applied. 10 c.c. of the copper solution
represents 0&middot;067 gramme of milk sugar.</p>

<p>The sugar in milk can also be estimated by the polariscope (see
under Sugar, p. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>). In case the Ventzke-Scheibler instrument is used,
65&middot;36 grammes of the sample are weighed out and introduced into a 100
cc. flask; about 5 cc. of plumbic basic acetate solution is added, and
the liquid is well shaken, and then allowed to stand at rest for a few
minutes. It is next filtered, its volume made up to the 100 cc. mark,
and the 20 cm. tube filled and the reading made; this divided by 2
gives the percentage of sugar in the milk.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Adams<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> has recently proposed
a method of milk analysis which consists in first placing 5 cc. of
the sample in a tared beaker, and then introducing a weighed paper
coil made of blotting paper from which all fatty matter has previously
been removed by washing with ether. As soon as the milk is completely
absorbed, the paper coil is removed and dried at 100&#176;. The increase
of weight gives the amount of <em>total solids</em>. The <em>fat</em> is next
extracted by petroleum naphtha or ether, and its weight determined.
The proportion of <em>solids not fat</em> is ascertained by again drying and
weighing the exhausted coil.</p>

pure milk, are:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the State of New York, the legal standards for milk are that it
shall not contain more than 88 per cent. of water, nor less than 12 per
cent. of milk solids, and 3 per cent. of fat.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the law fixing a chemical standard of purity for
milk reads: &#8220;In all cases of prosecution, if the milk shall be
shown upon analysis to contain more than 87 per cent. of water, or to
contain less than 13 per cent. of milk solids, it shall be deemed, for
the purpose of this Act, to be adulterated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Board of Health of New Jersey fixes the minimum amount of
total solids at 12 per cent. and the maximum amount of water at 88
per cent. In Paris, the minimum limits <em>for condemnation</em> are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Fat, 2&middot;70; milk-sugar, 4&middot;50; caseine, albumen, and ash, 4&middot;30; total
solids, 11&middot;50.</p>

<p>The following proportion can be employed in the calculation of the
amount of pure milk (<i>x</i>) contained in a suspected sample:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the total solids:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in4">12&middot;5: total solids found = 100 : <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>From the solids not fat:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in4">9&middot;30: solids not fat = 100 : <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>From the sugar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in4">4&middot;40: sugar found = 100 : <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>From the specific gravity:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in4">1&middot;030 : sp. gr. = 100 : <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>In most cases the determination of the total milk-solids and the
fat (the difference being the solids not fat) furnishes all the
data required for determining the amount of watering which a sample
of milk has undergone. The Society of Public Analysts use 9 as the
average percentage of solids <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>not fat in pure milk (which is generally
considered as too low) and adopt the formula:&mdash;</p>

  <span class="denominator">9</span>

<p>The addition of mineral salts to milk is detected by the increased
proportion of ash found; the presence of an abnormal amount of common
salt by the high proportion of chlorine present in the ash, which
in pure milk should never exceed 0&middot;14 per cent. The use of sodium
bicarbonate, borax, etc., is also detected by the analysis of the
ash. Glycerine, salicylic acid, flour, and starch, if added, can be
extracted from the milk-solids and their identity established by the
usual characteristic reactions.</p>

<p>The microscope is of great service in the determination of the
quality of milk, and especially in the detection of the presence of
abnormal bodies, such as pus, colostrum cells, and blood. In pure
cow&#8217;s milk the globules are in constant motion; their usual
size is <span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">5000</span> of an inch, but this depends upon the nature of the
food used. Plates IV. and V., which represent cream, pure milk,
skimmed milk, and milk containing colostrum cells, were taken from
photo-micrographic negatives furnished through the kindness of Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous cases of severe illness have from time to time been
developed by the use of milk which was apparently free from any of the
usual adulterants. In a recent issue of the &#8216;Philadelphia Medical
News&#8217; (Sept. 1886) an instance of wholesale milk poisoning at
Long Branch is described, and the results reached by a careful study of
the epidemic are given. It was demonstrated that warm milk, fresh from
the cow, if placed in closed cans under conditions which retarded the
dissipation of its heat, may suffer fermentation resulting within a few
hours in the genesis of a sufficient quantity of a poisonous ptomaine
(termed <em>tyrotoxicon</em>) to produce dangerous toxic effects in those
drinking it.</p>

<p>Tyrotoxicon was isolated from the milk, and obtained in
needle-shaped crystals, which reduced iodic acid and gave a
blue coloration when treated with potassium ferricyanide or
ferric chloride. Prof. Victor C. Vaughan<a name="FNanchor_25_25"
id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a> discovered the same alkaloid in poisonous
cheese, and has also detected its presence in ice-cream that had
been the cause of sickness. In this connection it is of importance
to note that the addition of gelatine to ice-cream is occasionally
practised: in case this substance is used while in a state of incipient
decomposition, the danger of the bacteria and other organisms present
subsequently resuming activity is considerable. It has been repeatedly
and conclusively demonstrated that milk from cows affected with
tuberculosis and other complaints, is capable of propagating the seeds
of disease, especially in children. The presence of impure water in
milk constitutes another source of danger. A test based upon the fact
that water which has received sewage contamination often contains
nitrites, is applied by first coagulating the suspected milk with
acetic acid, then filtering and adding to the filtrate a few cc. of an
equal mixture of sulphanilic acid and naphthylamine sulphate, when, in
presence of nitrites, a rose-red colour will be produced.</p>

<h2>BUTTER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Butter</span> is the fat of milk, containing
small proportions of caseine, water, and salt (the latter mostly
added), and possessing a somewhat granular structure. In its
preparation the fat-globules of cream are made to coalesce by the
process of churning, and are removed from the residual buttermilk. Its
colour, due to lactochrome, varies from white to yellow, according to
the breed and food of the cow. The fatty constituents of butter are
butyric, caproic, caprylic, capric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, and
oleic acids, which are combined with glycerine as ethers; the first
four are soluble in hot water, the remainder insoluble. It is very
probable that butter fat is composed of complex glycerides, <i>i. e.</i>
tri-acid (presumably oleic, palmitic, and butyric) ethers, of the
following character:&mdash;</p>

<p>The table on <a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a> exhibits a summary of
the results obtained by various chemists by the analysis of numerous
specimens of genuine butter.</p>

<p>Dr. Elwyn Waller found the following variations in the constituents
of pure butter:&mdash;Fat, from 83 to 85; water, from 8 to 10; curd,
from 1 to 3; salts, from 3 to 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Butter fat fuses at 28&#176; to 37&#176;, and at 37&#176;&middot;7 its specific
gravity ranges from 0&middot;91200 to 0&middot;91400. The<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> most common adulterations
of butter consist in the addition of water, salt, colouring matters,
and various foreign fats (notably oleomargarine). The first two
admixtures are easily recognised by the proximate analysis; the
detection of the last sophistication involves a somewhat elaborate
examination of the fatty constituents of the butter.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Proximate Analysis.</i></p>

<p>About five grammes of the well-averaged sample are weighed out
in a tared platinum capsule, and dried for three hours (or until
constant weight is obtained) over a water-bath (or over a low flame,
constantly stirring with a thermometer), and the decrease in weight
(water) ascertained. As a rule, the proportion of water in genuine
butter varies from 8 to 16 per cent. The residue in the capsule is
then melted at a gentle heat, and the liquid fat cautiously poured off
from the remaining caseine and salt, these latter being afterwards
more completely exhausted by washing with ether. Upon now drying the
residue, the loss in weight will give the amount of fat present.
The caseine is next determined by the loss in weight obtained upon
incinerating the matters left undissolved by the ether, the remaining
inorganic matter being the salt contained.</p>

<p>The proportion of fat present in genuine butter ranges from 82 to
90 per cent.; it should never be below 80 per cent. The average amount
of caseine is 2&middot;5 per cent.; greater proportions, frequently occurring
in unadulterated butter, render it more liable to become rancid. The
ash should consist of sodium chloride, with some calcium phosphate;
the amount of salt is quite variable, but it usually ranges from 2
to 7 per cent. The proportion of ingredients, not fat, in butter may
be conveniently determined by melting 10 grammes of the sample in
a graduated tube, provided with a scale at its lower end, which is
narrowed, adding 30 c.c. of petroleum naphtha,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> and shaking the mixture.
After standing a few hours, the non-fatty matters collect in the lower
portion of the tube, and their volume is read off. Genuine butter is
said to yield from 12 to 14 per cent. (assuming each c.c. to equal one
gramme), while adulterated specimens may show 20 per cent. of matters
not fat.</p>

<p class="center p1"><i>Examination of the Butter-fat.</i></p>

<p>The most common and important sophistication of butter consists in
the addition of foreign fats, embracing both animal fats (oleomargarine
and lard) and vegetable oils (cotton-seed, olive, rape-seed, cocoa-nut,
almond, palm, etc.). Of these, oleomargarine is doubtless the most
often employed. Oleomargarine is the more fusible portion of beef fat,
and is prepared by straining the melted fat, allowing the oil thus
obtained to stand for some time at a temperature of about 24&#176;, when
most of the stearine and palmitine will separate out, and cooling the
remaining oil until it solidifies. This is next churned with milk, a
little colouring matter (annato) being added, and the product is then
chilled by mixing it with ice; salt is now added, and the mass is
finally worked up into lumps.</p>

<p>It is stated that fifteen establishments in the United States are
engaged in the manufacture of oleomargarine, the annual production
in the State of New York alone being about 20,000,000 pounds. The
rapid increase in the manufacture of oleomargarine is shown by the
following statistics:&mdash;In 1880 this country exported 39,236,655
pounds of butter and 20,000,000 pounds of oleomargarine, while in
1885 the exportation of butter declined to 21,638,128 pounds, and the
exportation of oleomargarine reached nearly 38,000,000 pounds. The
present production is said to approximate 50,000,000 pounds per annum.
The most characteristic difference in the composition of genuine butter
and oleomargarine consists in the greater proportion of soluble fats
contained in the former. This is illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> by the following
comparative analysis of the two products (M&eacute;ge Mouri&egrave;s):&mdash;</p>

<p>Lard is likewise occasionally used in the United States as an
admixture to butter, the product, &#8220;lardine,&#8221; being sold
either as oleomargarine-butter, or as the genuine article. Dr. Munsell
mentions a factory in New York city where the weekly output of larded
butter is 5000 pounds. As a result of the efforts of the New York State
Dairy Commission, it has been estimated that the sale of imitation
butter in this State in 1885 suffered a decrease of about 60 per cent.,
although the quantity manufactured in the United States showed an
increase of 50 per cent.</p>

<p>The specific gravity and melting point of butter have been
suggested as criteria for its purity; in most cases, however, these
determinations possess a rather limited value; as already stated,
butter fat, at the temperature of 37&#176;&middot;7, has a density ranging from
0&middot;91200 to 0&middot;91400.</p>

<p>The relation between the specific gravity of a fat and the
proportion of insoluble acids contained was first noticed by Bell. This
is shown in the following table which refers to pure butter fat.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the fats mostly used to adulterate butter
are of a lower density. Blyth regards a gravity below 0&middot;911 (at 37&#176;&middot;5)
as clearly pointing to the presence of foreign fatty admixture.</p>

<p>The specific gravity determination is made by means of the
areometer, or by the gravity bottle; numerous indirect methods
have also been proposed. P. Casamajor<a name="FNanchor_26_26"
id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a> suggests a process for distinguishing genuine
butter from oleomargarine which is based upon the fact that the density
of a liquid in which a body remains in equilibrium is the density of
the body itself. As the result of his investigations it was found that
pure butter at 15&#176; would be held in equilibrium by alcohol of 53&middot;7
per cent. (sp. gr. = 0&middot;926), and that oleomargarine would remain in
equilibrium, at the same temperature, in alcohol of 59&middot;2 per cent.
(sp. gr. = 0&middot;905). If equal volumes of alcohol of 53&middot;7 per cent. and
59&middot;2 per cent. (<i>i.e.</i> an alcohol of 56&middot;5 per cent.) are taken, and
a drop of melted butter and of oleomargarine are delivered upon its
surface, the former will sink to the bottom and the latter will remain
at the top, so long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69"
id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> two globules are warm and liquid. In case
the temperature of the alcohol is about 30&#176;, the butter will solidify
and also rise to the top, whereas the oleomargarine may remain liquid.
On now keeping the alcohol for a short time at a temperature of 15&#176;
the oleomargarine becomes opaque, but remains at the top, while the
solidified butter will sink to the bottom. If alcohol of 59&middot;2 per cent.
is employed, oleomargarine will remain at the surface and genuine
butter fall to the bottom at all temperatures above 15&#176;, and at this
temperature oleomargarine will be in equilibrium. Since not over 33 per
cent. of butter is usually added to oleomargarine, it is proposed to
use alcohol of 55 per cent., and consider as oleomargarine any sample
which does not sink at 15&#176;.</p>

<p>The foregoing method can be applied quantitatively by determining
the strength of the alcohol which will keep in equilibrium a drop of
the fat under examination. Since the difference between 59&middot;2 and 53&middot;7
is 5&middot;5, the difference between the strength of the alcohol used and
53&middot;7, divided by 5&middot;5 (or multiplied by 0&middot;18), will give the proportion
of oleomargarine present. For example, if the globule is held in
equilibrium at 15&#176; in 57 per cent. alcohol, the sample contains about
60 per cent. of oleomargarine, for (57 - 53&middot;7) &times; 0&middot;18 = 3&middot;3
&times; 0&middot;18 = 0&middot;594 or, say, <span class="sup">6</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">10</span>.</p>

<p>The melting-point of butter is below that of most of its fatty
adulterants; as previously stated, it varies from 28&#176; to 37&#176;. The
determination is made either in the ordinary manner by means of a
fine tube, or a little of the chilled sample is attached to a looped
platinum wire, placed near the thermometer-bulb, in water which is
gradually heated until fusion takes place. Blyth gives the following
table of the melting-points of various fats:&mdash;</p>

<p>Numerous qualitative tests have been proposed by various authorities
for the detection of foreign fats in butter, of which the following are
perhaps sometimes of use. It should be added that the value of these
tests, when applied to mixtures, is limited and very uncertain.</p>

<p>1. A little of the sample is heated in a test-tube: pure butter
froths and acquires a brownish colour; with foreign fats there is but
little foaming, and, although the caseine present darkens, the liquid
itself remains comparatively clear.</p>

<p>2. If a sample containing oleomargarine is melted and the oil burned
in an ordinary lamp-wick, a decided odour of burning tallow will be
produced upon extinguishing the flame. Specimens of real butter,
however, have been found to also emit a tallow-like odour.</p>

<p>3. The melted sample is filtered and treated with boiling ether;
pure butter fat dissolves much more readily than do lard and tallow.
Upon adding methylic alcohol to the solution the latter fats are
precipitated, whereas pure butter will remain in solution.</p>

<p>4. If the filtered fat is distilled with a mixture of alcohol and
sulphuric acid, the distillate will possess the odour of butyric
ether <em>in a very marked degree</em>, in case it consists of butter.<a
name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>5. The strained fat is treated with a solution of carbolic acid
(1 part acid and 10 parts water): genuine butter dissolves to a
clear solution; beef, mutton, and swine fat<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> form two layers, the upper
one becoming turbid upon cooling.</p>

<p>6. If the sample consists of butter or oleomargarine, and is mixed
with about ten parts of glycerine and the emulsion digested with a
mixture of equal parts of ether and alcohol, two layers of solution
will be produced, without any deposit of solid matter between them;
if, however, lard, suet, or starch is present it will become deposited
between the layers.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that butter differs from some of
its fatty adulterants in containing a considerable proportion of
fatty acids which are soluble in hot water, the acids present in most
foreign fats being, on the other hand, almost entirely insoluble. The
estimation of the relative amounts of soluble and insoluble acids
contained in a fat possesses therefore much importance; indeed, more
significance attaches to this determination than to any other. The
processes most frequently employed in the quantitative examination of
butter fat are those of Koettstorfer, Hehner, and Reichert.</p>

<p>Koettstorfer&#8217;s method<a name="FNanchor_28_28"
id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is based upon the fact that, as butter
fat contains the fatty acids, having a smaller molecular weight
than those present in other fats, it must contain more molecules of
acid, and will therefore require a greater amount of an alkali to
effect saponication. The process is executed as follows:&mdash;One or
two grammes of the filtered fat are weighed out in a narrow beaker
and heated over a water-bath with about 25 c.c. of one-half normal
alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide. The saponification of the
fat is assisted by repeated stirring; when it is completed the beaker
is removed from the bath, a few drops of alcoholic phenol-phthaleine
added for an indicator, and the excess of potash used titrated back
with one-half normal hydrochloric acid. It has been found that pure
butter fat requires from 221&middot;4 to 232&middot;4 milligrammes of potassium<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
hydroxide for saponification. The following are the number of
milligrammes of alkali necessary for the saponification of one gramme
of various other fats:&mdash;</p>

<p>Taking 227 milligrammes as the average amount of potassium hydroxide
required to saponify one gramme of pure butter fat, the following
formula has been suggested for the estimation of the proportion of
admixture in a suspected sample:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(227 - <i>n</i>) &times; 3&middot;17 = <i>x</i>,</p>

<p>in which <i>n</i> represents the number of milligrammes of potassium
hydroxide used, and <i>x</i> the percentage of foreign fat added. In the
Paris Municipal Laboratory, 221 milligrammes of K(OH) are regarded as a
standard for the saponification of one gramme of genuine butter.</p>

<p>Cocoa-nut oil, unfortunately, requires a figure (250 mgr.)
considerably above that of butter, and it is quite possible
to prepare a mixture of this oil and oleomargarine, that
by the foregoing test would show a result almost identical
with that afforded by pure butter. Hehner&#8217;s process,<a
name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which is often employed for the determination
of the insoluble fatty acids, is as follows:&mdash;About 4 grammes of
the melted and strained sample are dissolved in 50 c.c. of alcohol,
containing two grammes of potassium hydroxide in solution, and the
mixture is heated until complete saponification takes place. The
alcohol is removed by evaporation, the residue dissolved in 200
c.c. of water, and the fatty acids precipitated by adding dilute
sulphuric acid to distinct acid reaction. The fatty acids are next
melted by heating the liquid and are then allowed to cool, after<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> which
the insoluble acids are poured upon a tared filter and repeatedly
washed with hot water until the washings cease to show acidity. The
filter and contents are finally cautiously dried and weighed. In
genuine butter the proportion of insoluble fatty acids ranges between
86&middot;5 and 87&middot;5 per cent.; it should not be above 88 per cent.<a
name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Oleomargarine, lard, mutton, beef, and
poppy, palm, olive, and almond oils contain about 95&middot;5 per cent. of
insoluble acids.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a
href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The preceding process is also imperfect in not effecting the
detection of cocoa-nut oil, which affords only about 86 per cent. of
insoluble fatty acids, and although the presence of any considerable
proportion of this oil in butter would probably be indicated by
the decreased melting point of the admixture, an estimation of
the soluble fatty acids is by far the most reliable means for
its detection. For this determination Reichert&#8217;s method<a
name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is eminently adapted. In this process
advantage is taken of the facts that the amount of soluble acids in a
mixture of fat bears a direct relation to the proportion of genuine
butter present, and that, if the aqueous solution of a saponified fat
is decomposed by an acid and heated to boiling, the greater portion of
the soluble acids escape with the watery vapours and can be collected
and determined in the distillate. The details of this method are
essentially as follows:&mdash;2&frac12; grammes of the filtered sample
are introduced into an Erlenmayer flask together with 1 gramme of
potassium hydroxide and 20 c.c. of dilute (80 per cent.) alcohol, and
the mixture is heated over the water-bath until complete saponification
is effected, and the alcohol <em>entirely</em> removed. The soap thus formed
is dissolved in 50 c.c. of water, and decomposed by adding 20 c.c.
of dilute sulphuric acid (1:10). The flask is next connected<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> with a
Liebig&#8217;s condenser and the contents carefully distilled until 50
c.c. have passed over. The distillate is now freed from any insoluble
acids possibly present by filtration; it is then titrated with
decinormal soda solution, a few drops of litmus solution being employed
as an indicator. As the result of numerous tests, it has been found
that genuine butter, when examined by the above method, requires from
13 to 15 c.c. of the decinormal solution. The following are the number
of c.c. required by various other fats:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Elwyn Waller<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> modifies the foregoing
method of procedure by adding 50 c.c. of water to the contents of the
flask remaining after the first distillation, and again distilling
off 50 c.c., the process being repeated until the final distillate
neutralises only 0&middot;1 c.c. of the decinormal alkali. With
butter fat, it was found that the first distillate contained about
79 per cent. of the total volatile acids present. By means of this
modification, a distinction between the rate of distillation of the
volatile fatty acids of different fats is possible. The non-volatile
acids left in the flask are washed several times with water, in order
to remove the glycerine and potassium sulphate present, and are then
dried and weighed.</p>

<p>For estimating the percentage of pure butter fat in a sample of
mixed fat, Reichert employed the formula: B = 7&middot;3 (<i>m</i> -
0&middot;3), in which <i>m</i> is the number of c.c. of soda solution used
in the titration.</p>

<p>Baron H&uuml;bl<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has recently
suggested a method for butter testing, which is founded upon the
fact that the three series <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>of fats (acetic, acrylic, and tetrolic),
unite in different proportions with the halogens (iodine, bromine,
and chlorine), to form addition products. Iodine has been found
especially well adapted to the examination of fats. The standard
solution employed is prepared by dissolving 25 grammes of iodine
in 500 c.c. of 95 per cent. alcohol, and adding to the solution a
solution of 30 grammes of mercuric chloride in 500 c.c. of alcohol.
The reagent is then standardised by means of a solution of 24 grammes
of sodium hyposulphite in 1 litre of water. The test is applied as
follows:&mdash;1 gramme of the sample under examination is introduced
into a flask and dissolved in 10 c.c. of pure chloroform. The iodine
reagent is then gradually added from a burette, the mixture being well
shaken, until the coloration produced indicates that an excess is
present, even after standing for about two hours; 15 c.c. of a 10 per
cent. potassium iodide solution and 150 c.c. of water are then added
and the excess of iodine present determined by means of the sodium
hyposulphite solution, and deducted from the total quantity used. The
amount of iodine (in grammes) absorbed is calculated to 100 grammes of
the fat; this is termed the iodine number. The examination of numerous
samples of genuine butter and oleomargarine, and other fats, made at
the laboratory of the New York State Dairy Commissioner, furnished the
following results:<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a

<p>It has been proposed to differentiate between butter
and oleomargarine by a determination of the proportion of
glycerine contained. Liebsch&uuml;tz<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> employs the following process for this
estimation: 10 grammes of the sample are saponified by heating with 20
grammes of barium hydroxide, until the water of crystallisation has
been almost entirely expelled. Alcohol is then added with constant
stirring; saponification quickly takes place, and is completed by
evaporating the mass nearly to dryness. The glycerine is extracted with
boiling water, the solution filtered, and the barium contained removed
by means of sulphuric acid. The filtrate from the barium sulphate is
then concentrated by evaporation, and the excess of sulphuric acid
present neutralised by adding a little barium carbonate. The filtered
liquid is now again evaporated to a small volume, and most of the
salts present precipitated by addition of absolute alcohol. After
filtration the alcoholic solution is evaporated over the water-bath,
then dried at 100&#176; until constant weight is obtained. It is finally
ignited and the proportion of glycerine contained estimated by the loss
in weight sustained. This process is certainly far from being exact,
owing principally to the volatilisation of glycerine that occurs in the
evaporation of its aqueous and even alcoholic solutions. The following
results were obtained upon treating genuine butter and oleomargarine
according to the above method:&mdash;</p>

<p>Gelatine is said to have lately been used as an adulterant of
butter, more especially of artificial butter. Its detection is a
matter of some difficulty. The following method has been suggested. A
considerable quantity of the suspected butter is boiled with water,
the solution strained, a drop of acetic acid and a little potassium
ferrocyanide added, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> the liquid boiled until the precipitate
formed becomes bluish in colour. The solution is then filtered hot
and the filtrate examined for gelatine by adding tannic acid to, or
conducting chlorine gas through it.</p>

<p>A sample lately imported under the name of &#8220;butter
preservative&#8221; was found by the author to consist of a
dilute solution of phosphoric acid. The use of this agent does
not, however, appear to be prevalent to any great extent.<a
name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><i>Artificial Colouring.</i>&mdash;The list of colouring matters said
to be added to butter includes the vegetable dyes, annato, carotin,
fustic, turmeric, marigold, and saffron; the coal-tar colour,
Victoria yellow (potassium dinitrocresylate), and Martius yellow
(potassium dinitronaphthalate), and the mineral pigment chrome
yellow (plumbic chromate). Of the foregoing, annato and carrot
colour appear to be most commonly employed. Mr. Edward W. Martin<a
name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> has proposed a method for the isolation
of the former which consists in dissolving the butter in carbon
disulphide, and shaking the solution with a <em>dilute</em> solution of
potassium hydroxide, in which the colouring matter dissolves; it
is subsequently identified by further tests. According to Mr.
R. W. Moore,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> the presence of
carotin in butter may be detected by first agitating the carbon
disulphide solution of the fat with alcohol, which fails to extract
this colour. Upon now adding to the mixture a drop of dilute ferric
chloride solution, again shaking the liquid and then putting it aside
for a short time, the alcoholic solution dissolves the carrot colour,
and if no other colouring matter is contained in the butter, leaves the
carbon disulphide colourless.</p>

<p>The artificially coloured butter may be dissolved in alcohol and
tested with the following reagents:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Nitric acid: greenish coloration, <em>saffron</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Sugar solution and hydrochloric acid: red coloration,
<em>saffron</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Ammonia: brownish coloration, <em>turmeric</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Silver nitrate: blackish coloration, <em>marigold</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Evaporate the alcoholic solution to dryness and add
concentrated sulphuric acid: greenish-blue coloration, annato; blue
coloration, <em>saffron</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Hydrochloric acid: decolorisation, with formation of yellow
crystalline precipitate, <em>Victoria or Martius yellow</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Separation of a heavy and insoluble yellow powder, <em>chrome
yellow</em> (see p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>).</p>

<p><i>Microscopic Examination.</i>&mdash;The microscopic examination of
butter has lately received considerable attention as a means for the
detection of the presence of foreign fats. Genuine butter generally
exhibits under the microscope a crowded mass of globules of fat, fatty
crystals being commonly absent. In oleomargarine a more crystalline
structure is observed, with pear-shaped masses of fat and but few
globules. While the presence of crystals in a sample may justly be
regarded as suspicious, it is by no means a positive evidence of
adulteration, since, under certain circumstances, pure butter may
present the same indications. In applying the microscopic test, a small
portion of the fat is made into a thin layer on the slide, and then
protected with a glass cover, applied with rather gentle pressure.</p>

<p>Plate VI.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a
href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> represents the
microscopic appearance of genuine butter and oleomargarine. It
will be observed that in butter (Fig. 1) numerous globules but no
crystals of fat are presented, the crystals present being those of
salt. In oleomargarine (Fig. 2) the distinctive pear-shaped masses
of fat, accompanied by only a small number of fatty globules, are to
be seen. Dr. Thomas Taylor (of the U.S. Department of Agriculture),
has made an elaborate investigation of the microscopic appearance of
various fats when viewed by polarised light. He regards the presence
of peculiar globular crystals and the black cross commonly termed
St. Andrew&#8217;s cross as characteristic of genuine butter.<a
name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Lard, beef, and other fats are said to
exhibit different and, to some extent, distinctive crystalline forms.
Prof. Weber,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> however, affirms that
mixtures of lard and tallow fat, under certain conditions, cannot be
distinguished from butter by means of this method of examination. More
recently, Dr. Taylor states that the distinguishing difference between
butter and other fats under the microscope is that the former, when
observed by polarised light through a selenite, exhibits a uniform
tint, whereas the latter shows prismatic colours. Although the results
of these investigations cannot as yet be considered as perfectly
satisfactory or conclusive, they certainly are entitled to rank as a
highly valuable and important step in advance of the optical processes
hitherto employed.</p>

<p class="p1">Plate VII. exhibits the appearance of butter,
oleomargarine, beef, and some other fats, when viewed by the microscope
and polarised light. It will be noticed that, while a discrimination
between lard and butter is readily made, oleomargarine presents the St.
Andrew&#8217;s cross, stated to be characteristic of genuine butter.
These photomicrographs represent the results of investigations made in
the Chemical Division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The question of the sanitary effects of oleomargarine and other
substitutes for butter, has been studied by many scientists, and with
very discordant results. Doubtless the great divergence of opinion
which at present exists, is largely due to the fact that the artificial
products examined have been made according to different processes,
and with varying regard to the quality of the fats used in their<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
manufacture, and to the degree of care and cleanliness observed. The
attention of the American public has very lately been directed to the
oleomargarine question, by the recent enactment of a national law
imposing a tax upon the manufacture of the article.</p>

<p>Without entering to any great extent into the subject of the
wholesomeness of artificial butter as it is generally met with
in commerce, it will be of interest to refer to the conclusions
reached by two or three sanitarians who have devoted particular
attention to this aspect of the question. Prof. W. O. Atwater<a
name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> summarises the results of his investigation
of oleomargarine as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1. The common kinds of imitation butter, oleomargarine,
butterine, etc., when properly made, agree very closely in chemical
composition, digestibility, and nutritive value with butter from
cow&#8217;s milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. In fulfilling one of the most important functions of food,
namely, that of supplying the body with heat and muscular energy, they,
with butter, excel in efficiency all, or nearly all, our other common
food materials.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. Considering the low cost at which they can be produced,
as well as their palatability and nutritive value, they form a
food product of very great economical importance, and one which is
calculated to greatly benefit a large class of our population whose
limited incomes make good dairy butter a luxury.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. Imitation butter, like many other manufactured food
materials, is liable (but in actual commerce has been found not to
be so) to be rendered unwholesome by improper materials and methods
of manufacture. It is also open to the especial objection that it is
largely sold as genuine butter. The interests of the public, therefore,
demand that it should be subjected to competent official inspection,
and that it should be sold for what it is, and not as genuine
butter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. S. B. Sharples<a name="FNanchor_44_44"
id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a> states: &#8220;When well made, it
(oleomargarine) is a very fair imitation of genuine butter; being
inferior to the best butter, but much superior to the low grades of
butter too commonly found in the market. So far as its influence on
health is concerned, I can see no objection to its use. Its sale as
genuine butter is a commercial fraud, and as such, very properly
condemned by the law. As to its prohibition by law, the same law which
prohibited it should also prohibit the sale of lard and tallow, and
more especially all low-grade butters, which are far more injurious to
health than a good sweet article of oleomargarine. A good deal has been
said in regard to the poor grade of fats from which the oleomargarine
is made. Any one making such assertions in regard to the fats is
simply ignorant of the whole subject. When a fat has become in the
least tainted, it can no longer be used for this purpose, as it is
impossible to remove the odour from the fat after it has once acquired
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per contra</i>, Dr. R. B. Clark, in an exhaustive report on butter,<a
name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a> affirms with great decision, that artificial
butter is not a wholesome article of food, for the following
reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1. On account of its indigestibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. On account of its insolubility when made from animal
fats.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. On account of its liability to carry germs of disease into
the human system.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. On account of the probability of its containing, when made
under certain patents, unhealthy ingredients.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two last grounds for condemning oleomargarine are evidently
affected by, and, in fact, dependent upon the character of the fat
and the exercise of care employed in its manufacture. In regard to
the relative digestibility of butter and its imitations, actual
experiments have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"
id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> made by several chemists. A. Mayer,<a
name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a> from the results of feeding human beings
for three days on butter and on oleomargarine, found that 1&middot;6 per
cent. less of the latter was absorbed by the system than of the
former, and inclines to the opinion, that with healthy persons
this proportion is so inconsiderable, that it is of little or no
importance. Dr. Clark considers these experiments of too limited
duration to be regarded as conclusive, although, so far as they went,
the results reached coincided with those obtained by him by a more
exhaustive investigation. Dr. Clark has made an examination of the
artificial digestion of butter as compared with oleomargarine and
other fats, including beef and mutton suet, and lard, cotton-seed,
sesam&eacute;, and cod-liver oils. The method of examination pursued was
as follows:&mdash;About 2 grammes of the melted fat was added to
a digestive fluid consisting of 0&middot;33 gramme of &#8220;extractum
pancreatis,&#8221; and 0&middot;33 gramme of sodium bicarbonate, dissolved
in 10 c.c. of distilled water. This mixture was introduced into a
test-tube, well shaken, and then exposed to a temperature of 40&#176;. The
contents of the test-tube were microscopically examined at the lapse
of intervals of one, four, and twelve hours. It was found from these
tests that cod-liver oil exhibited the most perfect state of emulsion,
after which came genuine butter, next lard oil, and then commercial
&#8220;oleo.&#8221; Plate VIII. represents the results obtained from
the experiments made with butter and commercial oleomargarine, as
presented at the end of one, four, and twelve hours. The globules of
butter-fat, it will be observed, are smaller in size and more uniform
in appearance. Dr. Clark likewise instituted experiments which tended
to demonstrate the relative insolubility of the fats used in the
preparation of artificial butter.</p>

<h2>CHEESE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheese</span> consists essentially of the
caseine and albumen of milk, together with water, fat, lactic acid, and
mineral salts. It is prepared by the coagulation of milk by means of
rennet, and is usually obtained from cow&#8217;s milk (either fresh,
skimmed, or sour), although the milk of the goat, ewe, and other
animals is occasionally used. Its colour is very often due to the
addition of annato. The following table exhibits the composition of the
best-known varieties of cheese, according to the analysis of various
chemists:&mdash;</p>

<p>The constituents of cheese are very similar to those of milk;
the relations between the soluble and insoluble fatty <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>acids
is much the same as in butter. In cheese, however, the milk-sugar is
largely decomposed into lactic acid, alcohol, and carbonic acid, during
the process of ripening or curing employed in its manufacture.</p>

<p>Another essential change effected by the curing of cheese is the
partial decomposition of the caseine into ammonia, which combines
with the unaltered caseine, forming soluble ammonium caseates. Other
products of the ripening process, also due to the decomposition of the
caseine, are tyrosine and leucine (C<span class="sub">6</span>H<span
class="sub">13</span>NO<span class="sub">2</span>). The butter-fats are
likewise transformed into the corresponding fatty acids, which give
rise to the formation of either the ammonia salts, acid albuminates, or
amines, such as butylamine or amylamine.</p>

<p>The characteristic odour of many varieties of cheese is chiefly
owing to the genesis of these latter compounds.</p>

<p>As with butter, the most important adulteration of cheese consists
in the addition of foreign fats. Doubtless, the most frequent
sophistication is the admixture of lard. Lard cheese (which is usually
sold as &#8220;Neufchatel&#8221;) is made by first preparing an
emulsion of lard and skimmed milk (in the proportion of one part of the
former to two parts of the latter). This is subsequently incorporated
with skimmed milk and butter-milk, the coagulation of the fat being
then effected in the usual manner. In regard to the production of
this species of cheese, it is stated that in the 23 factories in the
State of New York, the product of six months&#8217; working (ending
November, 1881), was about 800,000 pounds, of which the greater
proportion was exported. The recent (1885) adoption of a New York
State brand for &#8220;pure cream cheese&#8221; has had a very good
effect, and accomplished much in the restriction of the manufacture
and sale of the spurious article. Another variety of imitation cheese,
know as &#8220;anti-huff cheese,&#8221; is prepared from skimmed milk
without the addition of foreign fat, but with the aid of various
chemical preparations, such as caustic or carbonated soda, saltpetre,
and borax. The rind of cheese is occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> contaminated with poisonous
metallic salts, including those of lead, mercury, antimony, arsenic,
copper and zinc, which are added either for colouring purposes or
to prevent the attacks of flies and other insects. This form of
adulteration is doubtless of rare occurrence. The methods used in
cheese analysis are much the same as those employed in the examination
of butter. The fat is determined by exhaustion with ether (or
preferably, petroleum naphtha), and evaporation, the remaining solids
not fat being likewise dried and weighed. The difference between the
combined weight of the fat and the solids not fat, and the amount of
the sample taken, represents the proportion of water present. Lactic
acid, while insoluble in petroleum naphtha, is also dissolved by ether,
and can be estimated by digesting another portion of the sample with
water, and titrating the filtered liquid with decinormal soda solution.
Its weight is then to be deducted from the amount of fat previously
obtained, in case ether was employed in this determination. The
relative proportions of the soluble and insoluble fatty acids contained
in cheese possess the same significance in indicating the presence
of oleomargarine and other foreign fats as with butter; and they are
determined by the same methods.</p>

<p>The examination of the colouring matter of cheese can be made
by first neutralising the free lactic acid, separating the fat by
agitation with water, filtering and drying; the fat is then tested with
carbon disulphide and potassium hydroxide (see p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>).</p>

<h2>FLOUR AND BREAD.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheat</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triticum vulgare</i>) forms the
principal bread-stuff of civilized nations, and is by far the most
important of all cereal grasses. It has one or more slender, erect and
smooth stalks, which, owing to the large proportion of siliceous matter
present, possesses the strength necessary for the support of the ears.
The grain is imbricated in four rows. The following are the averages of
the results obtained by the analyses of 260 samples of American wheat,

<p class="ph3 p4">FLOUR.</p>

<p>The name flour is usually given to the product obtained by grinding
wheat and removing the bran, or woody portion of the grain, by sifting
or bolting. Its constituents are starch, dextrine, cellulose, and sugar
(carbohydrates), the nitrogenous compounds albumen, gliadin, mucin,
fibrin, and cerealin, and fat, mineral substances and water. Upon
kneading flour with water, and removing the starch and soluble matters
by repeated washing, an adhesive body termed <em>gluten</em> remains behind.
This is chiefly composed of gliadin, mucin, and fibrin.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Analysis of Flour.</span></p>

<p>The following are the determinations generally required in the
proximate analysis of flour:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Water.</i>&mdash;Two or three grammes of the sample are weighed in a
tared platinum dish, and heated in an air bath, until constant weight
is obtained. The proportion of water should not exceed 17 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Starch.</i>&mdash;A small amount of the flour is placed in a flask,
connected with an ascending Liebig&#8217;s condenser, and boiled for
several hours with water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid. Any
remaining excess of acid is then neutralised with sodium hydroxide; the
solution is considerably diluted, and the glucose formed, estimated by
means of Fehling&#8217;s solution (see p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>). 100 parts of glucose
represent 90 parts of starch.</p>

<p><i>Fat.</i>&mdash;The inconsiderable proportion of fat in flour is best
determined by exhausting the dried sample with ether and evaporating
the solution.</p>

<p><i>Gluten</i> (albuminoids).&mdash;As previously stated, gluten is
separated by kneading the flour and repeated washing with water.
After the removal of the amylaceous and soluble ingredients, the
residue is carefully dried and weighed. A far more accurate method
is to make a combustion of a small portion of the flour with cupric
oxide, and determine the quantity of nitrogen obtained, the percentage
of which, multiplied by 6&middot;33, gives the percentage of gluten.<a
name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The proportion of gluten in flour ranges from
about 8 to 18 per cent. From 10 to 12 per cent, is deemed necessary
in order to make good bread, and, in England,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> any deficiency in this
constituent is remedied by the addition of bean or other flour, but in
the United States this practice is seldom required.</p>

<p><i>Substances soluble in cold water.</i>&mdash;About five grammes of
the flour are digested with 250 c.c. of cold water, and the solution
filtered, and evaporated to dryness. Good flour is stated to yield 4&middot;7
per cent. of extract when treated in this manner, the soluble matters
consisting of sugar, gum, dextrine, vegetable albumen, and potassium
phosphate. The latter salt, which constitutes about 0&middot;4 per cent. of
the extract, should form the only mineral matter present.</p>

<p><i>The Ash.</i>&mdash;The ash of flour is determined in the usual manner,
by ignition in a platinum dish. It varies in amount from 0&middot;3 to 0&middot;8 per
cent., and should never exceed a proportion of 1&middot;5 per cent.</p>

<p>When of good quality, wheaten flour is perfectly white, or has only
a faint tinge of yellow. It should be free from bran, and must not show
red, grey, or black specks, nor possess a disagreeable odour. It should
also exhibit a neutral reaction and a decided cohesiveness, acquiring
a peculiar soft and cushion-like condition when slightly compressed.
Formerly, wheaten flour was mixed with various foreign meals, such as
rye, corn, barley, peas, beans, rice, linseed, buckwheat, and potato
starch; but at present this form of adulteration is probably but
rarely resorted to, at least in the United States. The presence of
mildew, darnel, ergot, and other parasites of the grain, constitutes
an occasional contamination of flour. The most frequent admixture
consists, however, in the addition of alum, which, although more
extensively used in bread, is also employed in order to disguise the
presence of damaged flour in mixtures, or to improve the appearance of
an inferior grade; its addition to a damaged article serves to arrest
the decomposition of the gluten, thereby preventing the flour from
acquiring a dark colour, and disagreeable taste and odour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"
id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>It has recently been stated that in flour which has been kept for a
long time in sacks, a transformation of the gluten sometimes occurs,
resulting in the production of a poisonous alkaloid. This body may be
separated by evaporating the ethereal extract of the flour to dryness,
and treating the residue with water. The presence of the alkaloid in
the filtered aqueous solution is recognised by means of potassium
ferrocyanide. The presence of an excessive proportion of moisture is
doubtless instrumental in the formation of toxic alkaloids or fungi in
old flour and bread.</p>

<p>Pure wheaten flour is coloured yellow when treated with ammonium
hydroxide, whereas corn meal assumes a pale brown colour, and the meals
prepared from peas, beans, etc., become dark brown in colour when
tested in this way. Nitric acid imparts an orange-yellow colour to
wheaten flour, but fails to change the colour of potato-starch, with
which it forms a stiff and tenacious paste.</p>

<p>Potato-starch is readily detected by examining a thin layer of the
sample on a slide under the microscope, and adding a dilute solution
of potassium hydroxide, which, while not affecting the wheaten starch,
causes the potato-starch granules to swell up very considerably.
Leguminous starches, such as peas, etc., contain approximately 2&middot;5 per
cent. of mineral matter; in pure flour, the average proportion of ash
is only about 0&middot;7 per cent., and this difference is sometimes useful in
the detection of an admixture of the former.</p>

<p>The external envelope of the granules of potato-starch offers far
less resistance when triturated in a mortar than that of wheat, and
upon this fact a simple test for their detection is founded. It is
executed by rubbing up a mixture consisting of equal parts of the
sample and sand with water, diluting and filtering the paste formed,
and then adding to it a solution of 1 part of iodine in 20 parts
of water. In the absence of potato-starch, an evanescent pink<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> colour
is produced; in case it is present, the colour obtained is dark purple,
which in time also disappears.</p>

<p>Among the methods which have been suggested for the detection of
such accidental impurities as darnel, ergot, and mildew, are the
following:&mdash;If pure flour is digested for some time with dilute
alcohol, the latter either remains quite clear or it acquires a very
light straw-colour; with flour contaminated with darnel, the alcohol
shows a decided greenish tint, and possesses an acrid and disagreeable
taste. In case the alcohol used is acidulated with about 5 per cent.
of hydrochloric acid, the extract obtained exhibits a purple-red
colour with flour containing mildew, and a blood-red colour with flour
containing ergot. When flour contaminated with ergot or other moulds,
is treated with a dilute solution of aniline violet, the dye is almost
wholly absorbed by the damaged granules, which are thus rendered more
noticeable in the microscopic examination.</p>

<p>The following test is often used for the detection of alum in
flour:&mdash;A small quantity of the suspected sample is made into a
paste with a little water and mixed with a few drops of an alcoholic
tincture of logwood; a little ammonium carbonate solution is then
added. In the presence of alum, a lavender-blue coloured lake is
formed, which often becomes more apparent upon allowing the mixture
to remain at rest for a few hours. The production of a brown or pink
coloration is an indication of the absence of alum. A modification of
this test, proposed by Blyth, consists in immersing for several hours
in the cold aqueous extract of the flour a strip of gelatine, with
which the alum combines; the gelatine is subsequently submitted to the
action of the logwood tincture and ammonium carbonate as above.</p>

<p>For the quantitative estimation of alum in flour, the following
processes are usually employed:&mdash;A considerable quantity of the
sample is incinerated in a platinum dish, the ash is boiled with
dilute hydrochloric acid and the solution filtered. The filtrate
is next boiled and added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93"
id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> a concentrated solution of pure sodium
hydroxide, the mixture being again boiled and afterwards filtered hot.
A little sodium diphosphate is now added to the filtrate which is then
slightly acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and finally made barely
alkaline by addition of ammonium hydroxide. The resulting precipitate,
which, in the presence of alum, consists of aluminium phosphate, is
brought upon a filter, well washed, and then weighed.</p>

<p>Another method, which is a modification of that of Dupr&eacute;, is
as follows:&mdash;The ash obtained by the calcination of the flour
(or bread), is fused, together with four times its weight of pure
mixed sodium and potassium carbonates, the fused mass treated with
hydrochloric acid, the solution evaporated to dryness and the separated
silica collected and weighed. A few drops of sodium phosphate solution
are added to the filtrate from the silica, then ammonium hydroxide
in excess, by which the calcium, magnesium, ferric and aluminium
phosphates are precipitated. The two latter are next separated by
boiling the liquid with an excess of acetic acid (in which they are
insoluble), and brought upon a filter, washed, dried, and weighed. The
iron sometimes accompanying the precipitate of aluminium phosphate,
can be determined by reduction with zinc and titration with potassium
permanganate. If the presence of alum is indicated by the logwood
test, and it is quantitatively determined by either of the preceding
methods, it has been suggested that an allowance be made for the small
proportion of aluminium silicate occasionally found in unadulterated
flour or bread, and a deduction from the total alum present of one
part of alum for every part of silica obtained is considered proper.
The weight of aluminium phosphate found, multiplied by 3&middot;873, or by
3&middot;702, gives respectively the corresponding amounts of potash-alum or
ammonia-alum contained in the sample examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph3 p2">BREAD.</p>

<p>Bread is usually prepared by mixing flour with water,
kneading it into a uniform dough, submitting it to a process of
&#8220;raising,&#8221; either by means of a ferment or by the direct
incorporation of carbonic acid gas, and finally baking the resulting
mass.</p>

<p>Unleavened bread, however, is made by simply kneading flour with
water, with the addition of a little salt, and baking. The oatcake of
the Scotch, the passover bread of the Israelites, and the corncakes
of the Southern States are the best known varieties of unleavened
bread.</p>

<p>The porosity peculiar to raised bread is caused by the generation of
a gas, either previous to, or during the process of baking. In former
times (and to some extent at present, notably in Paris), fermented
bread was made by the use of <em>leaven</em>, which is dough in a state of
incipient decomposition; but in this country, the common agent employed
in raising bread is yeast, which consists of minute vegetable cells
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Torula cerevisi&aelig;</i>) forming either the froth or deposit of
fermenting worts.</p>

<p>By the action of these ferments, the gluten of the flour first
undergoes a modification and enters into a peculiar combination with
the starch-granules, which become more or less ruptured; the soluble
albumen is rendered insoluble, and the starch is transformed, first
into sugar, then into carbonic acid and alcohol. These changes are
perfectly analogous to those which occur in the fermentation of the
wort in the preparation of fermented liquors.</p>

<p>Other and minor decompositions likewise occur, such as the partial
conversion of the starch into dextrine, the sugar into lactic acid,
and the alcohol into acetic acid, but the most essential change is
the production of alcohol and carbonic acid. The alcohol formed is
mainly volatilised, although an average proportion of 0&middot;3 per cent.
of this compound has been found in samples of fresh bread. The<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> escape
of the carbonic acid is retarded by the gluten, and to its expansion is
due the porous or spongy appearance of well-made bread.</p>

<p>Of late years, artificial substitutes for the fermentation process
in the production of porous bread have been extensively employed. By
the use of these agents, the liberation of carbonic acid in the dough
is accomplished and a slight gain of weight is effected, as none of the
original ingredients of the flour are lost by fermentation.</p>

<p>&#8220;A&euml;rated bread&#8221; is made by kneading the flour
under pressure with water highly charged with carbonic acid gas,
which, upon the removal of the pressure, expands, and gives porosity
to the bread. The use of &#8220;baking powders&#8221; effects the
same result in a more convenient manner, and is largely practised in
families. These compounds generally consist of sodium bicarbonate
(sometimes partially replaced by the corresponding ammonia salt),
and tartaric acid, or potassium bitartrate, together with rice or
other flour. A more commendable preparation is a mixture of sodium
bicarbonate with potassium or calcium acid phosphates, the use of
which is claimed to restore to the bread the phosphates lost by the
removal of the bran from the flour. Baking powders are often mixed
in the dry state with flour, and the produce, which is known under
the name of &#8220;self-raising flour,&#8221; only requires to be
kneaded with water and baked to form porous bread. However great the
convenience attending the use of these compounds, they are often open
to the objection that their decomposition gives rise to the formation
of aperient salts, <i>e.g.</i> sodium tartrate, and that they are very
frequently contaminated with alum.</p>

<p>As a result of the chemical changes which take place in the
fermentation of the flour and the subsequent application of heat,
the composition of bread differs materially from that of the grain
from which it is prepared. As already mentioned, the soluble
albuminoids are rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96"
id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> insoluble, and the starch is partially
transformed into sugar (maltose). The unconverted starch is modified in
its physical condition, the ruptured granules being far more readily
acted upon by the digestive fluids than before. The proportion of
soluble carbohydrates is naturally augmented in bread. The amount of
ash is also somewhat increased, chiefly owing to the addition of salt,
but it should not exceed a proportion of 2 per cent. The quantity
of water in bread varies considerably. Wanklyn fixes 34 per cent.
as the standard; greater proportions have, however, been frequently
found. In ten samples of apparently normal bread, examined by E. S.
Wood, Analyst to the Massachusetts State Board of Health, the amounts
of moisture contained varied from 34 to 44 per cent. The quantity
of water decreases very rapidly upon exposure to the air. Thus,
Clifford Richardson<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> found that bread which
showed 36 per cent. of moisture when freshly baked, contained but 5&middot;86
per cent. after drying for two weeks. Stale bread would seem to contain
water in a peculiar molecular condition, and, as is well known, upon
heating (&#8220;toasting&#8221;), it reassumes the porous state.</p>

<p>According to analyses collected by K&ouml;nig,<a
name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the mean composition of bread is as

<p>The analysis of bread is conducted essentially in the same manner
as that of flour. Under ordinary circumstances, the determinations
required are limited to an estimation of the moisture contained in
the crumb, the amount of the ash, and special tests for the presence
of alum and copper salts. Owing to the broken condition of the starch
granules in bread, their identification by the microscope is usually
rendered exceedingly difficult. The logwood test for alum in bread
is applied by Bell as follows:&mdash;About 10 grammes of the crumb
are immersed in a little water containing 5 c.c. each of the freshly
prepared logwood tincture and solution of ammonium carbonate for about
five minutes, after which the liquid is decanted, and the bread dried
at a gentle heat. In the presence of alum the bread will acquire
the characteristic lavender tint mentioned under Flour. It should
be added, that salts of magnesia also produce a lavender lake with
alum; but this fact does not affect the usefulness of the process as
a preliminary test to the quantitative determination of the mineral
impurities present in the sample under examination. The quantitative
examination of alum in bread is made by one of the methods described on
p. 93. Bread, free from alum, will sometimes yield 0&middot;013 per cent.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> of
aluminium phosphate, and this amount should therefore be deducted from
the weight of the precipitate obtained.</p>

<p>The average of the results obtained by Dr. Edward G. Love, New York
State Board of Health, from the examination of the crumb of ten samples
of the cheaper varieties of wheaten bread were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the addition of alum to bread is prevalent seems to admit of
little doubt. The British Public Analysts, in 1879, tested 1287 samples
of bread, of which 95 (or 7&middot;3 per cent.) contained alum. Of 18 samples
examined, in 1880, in the city of Washington, 8 were adulterated with
the salt. The question of the sanitary effects produced by the use of
alumed bread is one which has given rise to very extended discussion.
According to some authorities, the conversion of alum into an insoluble
salt by the fermentation process, which takes place in bread-making,
is regarded as a proof that it remains inert, and is consequently
harmless in its effects. Others contend that its action as a preventive
of excessive fermentation is at the expense of valuable nutritious
constituents of the flour, and that its combination with the phosphates
present in the grain results in the formation of an insoluble salt
which tends to retard digestion. Experiments have been made by J. West
Knights, on the comparative action of artificial gastric juice upon
pure and alumed bread, which apparently support this latter view.</p>

<p>Another objection to the use of alum is that it is frequently
employed for the purpose of disguising the bad quality of damaged and
inferior grades of flour. The presence of copper salts in bread is of
rare occurrence. Their detection is accomplished by treating a portion
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the crumb with a dilute solution of potassium ferrocyanide acidulated
with acetic acid, which, in presence of copper, will impart a
reddish-brown colour to the bread. If contained in any appreciable
proportion, it can be extracted from the ash obtained by the
incineration of the bread, and deposited upon the interior of a weighed
platinum capsule by the electrolytic method.</p>

<p><i>Starch</i> (C<span class="sub">6</span>H<span
class="sub">10</span>O<span class="sub">5</span>).&mdash;Starch, which
enters so largely into the composition of cereals, is a carbo-hydrate,
<i>i. e.</i> hydrogen and oxygen are contained in the proportions necessary
to form water. In this respect, it is identical with woody fibre,
cellulose, and dextrine.</p>

<p>The well-known dark-blue colour produced upon the addition of a
solution of iodine to starch-paste forms the usual qualitative test
for its presence. This coloration is discharged by alkalies and by a
solution of sulphurous acid. The quantitative estimation of starch in
mixtures is best effected by heating the dry substance in a closed
tube for 24 hours, together with a dilute hot alcoholic solution of
potassium hydroxide. The hot liquid is next filtered, the residue
washed with alcohol, and the filtrate heated with 2 per cent. solution
of hydrochloric acid until it ceases to show the blue coloration when
tested with iodine. It is then rendered alkaline, and the proportion
of starch originally present, calculated from the amount of sugar
formed, as determined by Fehling&#8217;s solution. Although identical
in chemical composition, the various forms of starch met with in the
vegetable kingdom vary in size and exhibit characteristic differences
in the appearance of the granules. The following are measurements of
several varieties of starch granules:&mdash;</p>

<p>The larger granules of potato starch, when suspended<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> in
water, subside more rapidly than those of wheat starch; they are also
far more readily ruptured.</p>

<p>The identification of the various starches is accomplished by means
of the microscope. Starch possesses an organised structure which,
fortunately, differs in different plants. Besides varying in size,
the granules develope in a different manner and form from centres of
growth, and therefore exhibit characteristic conditions and positions.
These distinctions, together with their effect upon polarised light,
are of great utility in the determination of the source of any
particular starch. For this purpose, it is necessary to become familiar
with the distinctive microscopical appearance of each individual
starch. A collection of those most usually met with should be made,
and, after careful study, preserved in a dried state for comparative
purposes. Polarised light is a very useful adjunct in the examination
of starch granules. In the microscopical investigation, a minute
portion of the sample is placed upon the glass slide and well moistened
with a solution of 1 part glycerine in 2 parts of water; it is then
protected by a thin glass cover, which is put on with gentle pressure.
The appearance of various starches, under polarised light, is seen in
Plate IX., where the cross lies at the hilum or nucleus of the granule
and the form and relative size is visible in outline. This plate, and
Plates VII. and XII. are copied, with permission, from Bulletin No. 11
of the Chemical Division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The
original negatives (made by Clifford Richardson) were used, but the
auto-types are presented in a somewhat modified form.</p>

<h2>BAKERS&#8217; CHEMICALS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> substances employed for the
artificial production of porosity in bread, as already mentioned, are
sodium bicarbonate (now termed &#8220;saleratus&#8221;), potassium
bitartrate, tartaric acid, and calcium diphosphate, the various
mixtures of these compounds being known as baking powders. Some of the
above chemicals are not always used in the pure state, and, in addition
to this source of contamination, baking powders are often excessively
diluted with flour or starch, and seriously adulterated with alum.</p>

<p>The sodium bicarbonate employed is generally a fairly pure article.
Common grades of the salt contain a little sodium chloride, and in some
cases as much as 2 per cent. of the corresponding sulphate; it may
also prove to be somewhat deficient in the proportion of carbonic acid
present. Cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), is far more liable to
adulteration. A certain quantity of calcium tartrate is often found in
the commercial article, originating from its method of manufacture, and
amounting, on the average, from 6 to 7 per cent. The salt is, moreover,
sometimes intentionally mixed with alum, starch, tartaric acid, gypsum,
chalk and terra alba.</p>

<p>Occasionally so-called cream of tartar has been found to be wholly
composed of starch and calcium diphosphate. In the examination for
calcium tartrate and sulphate, a quantitative determination of the
total lime and sulphuric acid is made. The quantity of sulphuric
acid obtained is calculated to gypsum, any excess of lime left being
returned as tartrate. The ash in pure cream of tartar should amount to
36&middot;79 per cent., while that of calcium tartrate<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> is only 21&middot;54 per cent.
Naturally, the addition of flour or starch would materially decrease
the proportion of ash. The presence of these latter adulterants is
recognised by means of the microscope, and by testing the sample with
iodine solution. It is generally required that cream of tartar should
contain at least 90 per cent. of potassium bitartrate.</p>

<p><i>Baking powders.</i>&mdash;The usual composition of baking powders has
already been stated. They all contain sodium bicarbonate, but differ
in the acid ingredient present, which may consist of cream of tartar,
tartaric acid, calcium diphosphate, or alum. In order to remedy the
tendency to deterioration which exists in powders entirely composed
of the above salts, it is the practice to add a considerable amount
of &#8220;filling&#8221; (corn-starch, flour, etc.). The quantity of
filling employed for this purpose varies from 20 to 60 per cent., but
is as a rule, greater than is really necessary. A small proportion of
the sodium salt is often replaced by ammonium sesquicarbonate. Alum is
a more objectionable constituent of many preparations, and it should
be considered an adulteration. The practical value of baking powder is
chiefly dependent upon the quantity of carbonic acid it liberates when
decomposed, and this is affected by the strength of the acid salt and
the amount of &#8220;filling&#8221; used. The most common varieties of
baking powders are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar</i>, either pure or mixed
with starch. In testing this class of powders, it is usual to determine
the excessive alkalinity remaining after the decomposition with water,
by means of decinormal acid; this is put down as bicarbonate present in
excess. The proportions of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar are
calculated from the alkaline strength of the ash, minus the excessive
alkalinity found.</p>

<p>Impurities originating from the cream of tartar employed are
estimated as previously described; and the amount of starch contained
is determined by the usual methods. In<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> some preparations,
tartaric acid is substituted for cream of tartar.</p>

<p>The following proportions represent the composition of a baking
powder of good quality:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Sodium bicarbonate and calcium diphosphate.</i>&mdash;Calcium
sulphate occurs as an impurity in the commercial phosphate and is
therefore liable to be met with in phosphate powders. In addition to
phosphoric acid, lime, etc., a determination of sulphuric acid and
chlorine should be made.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Sodium bicarbonate and alum.</i>&mdash;These constitute the
most reprehensible forms of baking powder. The sanitary effects of
alum have been referred to under Flour. It may be present either as
potash or ammonia alum. The following is a fair example of an alum
powder:&mdash;</p>

<p>From an exhaustive investigation of baking powders made by Dr. Henry
A. Mott, it was found that about 50 per cent. of these preparations
were impure, alum being the chief admixture. Of 280 samples of cream
of tartar lately examined by various American Health Boards, 100 were
adulterated; of 95 baking powders tested, 16 were adulterated.</p>

<h2>SUGAR.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sugars of commerce may be
conveniently classified into two varieties, viz., sucrose (cane sugar
or saccharose) and dextrose (grape sugar or glucose). The former,
which is the kind almost exclusively employed for domestic uses, is
chiefly obtained from the sugar cane of the West Indies and American
Southern States (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saccharum officinarum</i>), and, in continental Europe,
from the sugar beet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beta vulgaris</i>). A comparatively small quantity
is manufactured in the United States from the sugar maple (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer
saccharinum</i>), and from sorghum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sorghum saccharatus</i>).</p>

<p><i>Cane Sugar</i> (C<span class="sub">12</span> H<span
class="sub">22</span> O<span class="sub">11</span>).&mdash;Among
the more important chemical properties of cane sugar are the
following:&mdash;It dissolves in about one-third its weight of cold
water&mdash;much more readily in hot water&mdash;and is insoluble in
cold absolute alcohol. From a concentrated aqueous solution it is
deposited in monoclinic prisms, which possess a specific gravity of
1&middot;580. Cane sugar is characterised by its property of rotating the
plane of a ray of polarised light to the right; the rotary power is
66&#176;&middot;6. Upon heating its solution with dilute mineral acids, it is
converted into a mixture termed &#8220;invert sugar,&#8221; which
consists of equal parts of <em>dextrose</em> and <em>levulose</em>. The former turns
the plane of polarised light to the right, the latter to the left; but
owing to the stronger rotation exerted by the levulose, the combined
rotary effect of invert sugar is to the left, <i>i. e.</i>, opposite to that
possessed by cane sugar. Invert sugar exhibits the important property
of reducing solutions of the salts of copper, which is not possessed by
pure cane sugar. Cane sugar melts at 160&#176;; at a higher temperature<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
(210&#176;) it is converted into a reddish-brown substance termed <em>caramel</em>.
When subjected to the action of ferments, cane sugar is first
transformed into invert sugar, then into alcohol and carbonic acid,
according to the reactions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(<i>a</i>) C<span class="sub">12</span> H<span
class="sub">22</span> O<span class="sub">11</span> + H<span
class="sub">2</span>O = 2 C<span class="sub">6</span> H<span
class="sub">12</span> O<span class="sub">6</span>.<br />

(<i>b</i>) C<span class="sub">6</span> H<span class="sub">12</span> O<span
class="sub">6</span> = 2 CO<span class="sub">2</span> + 2 C<span
class="sub">2</span> H<span class="sub">6</span>O.</p>

<p>The varieties of cane sugar usually met with in commerce are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Loaf sugar, consisting either of irregular fragments, or (more
often) of cut cubes.</p>

<p>2. Granulated sugar.</p>

<p>3. Soft white sugar.</p>

<p>4. Brown sugar, varying in colour from cream-yellow to
reddish-brown.</p>

<p>Molasses is a solution of sugar, containing invert sugar, gummy
matters, caramel, etc., which forms the mother-liquor remaining after
the crystallisation of raw cane sugar; the name &#8220;syrup&#8221;
being commonly applied to the residual liquor obtained in the
manufacture of refined sugar.</p>

<p><i>Dextrose</i> (C<span class="sub">6</span> H<span class="sub">12</span>
O<span class="sub">6</span>), occurs ready-formed in grape juice, and
in many sweet fruits, very frequently associated with levulose; it is
also contained in honey, together with a small amount of cane sugar.
As already mentioned, it constitutes an ingredient of the product
obtained by the action of acids and ferments upon cane sugar. For
commercial purposes, glucose is prepared by treating grains rich in
starch, with dilute acids. In France and Germany, potatoes are used
in its manufacture; in the United States, Indian corn or maize is
almost exclusively employed. The processes used consist substantially
in first separating the starch from the grain by soaking, grinding,
and straining, then boiling it, under pressure, with water containing
about 3 per cent. of sulphuric acid, neutralising the remaining acid
with chalk, decolorising the solution by means of animal charcoal,
and concentrating it in vacuum pans. In<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> the United States
thirty-two factories are engaged in the manufacture of glucose, which
consume about 40,000 bushels of corn daily, their annual production
having an estimated value of 10 millions of dollars. In commerce,
the term grape sugar is applied to the solid product, the syrup or
liquid form being known as glucose. The chief uses of starch sugar and
glucose are in the manufacture of table syrups, and as a substitute
for malt in the brewing of beer and ale. Their other most important
applications are as a substitute for cane sugar in confectionery, and
in the preparation of fruit jellies; as an adulterant of cane sugar, as
an admixture to genuine honey, and as a source for the preparation of
vinegar.</p>

<p>Dextrose is soluble in 1<span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">5</span> part of cold water, and is much more
soluble in hot water. It has a dextro-rotary power of 56&#176;. When
separated from its aqueous solution, it forms white and opaque granular
masses, but from an alcoholic solution, it is obtained in well-defined,
microscopic needles, which fuse at 146&#176;. Two parts of glucose have
about the same sweetening effect as one part of cane sugar.<a
name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It does not become coloured when mixed with
cold concentrated sulphuric acid, which distinguishes it from sucrose;
on the other hand, its solution is coloured dark-brown if boiled with
potassium hydroxide, another distinction from cane sugar. Dextrose is
capable of directly undergoing vinous fermentation, and, like invert

<p><i>Maltose</i> and <i>levulose</i> are isomers of dextrose. The former is
prepared by the action of malt or diastase upon starch. It has a
dextro-rotary power of 150&#176; and its property of reducing copper salts
is only about 60 per cent. of that of dextrose. It is converted into
the latter compound upon boiling with dilute sulphuric acid. Levulose,
as previously stated, is formed, together with dextrose, from cane
sugar by treatment with dilute acids or with ferments. It turns the
plane of a ray of polarised light to the left, its rotary power varying
considerably at different temperatures.</p>

<p><i>Lactose</i>, or milk sugar, has already been referred to under the
head of Milk. It is isomeric with cane sugar, possesses a dextro-rotary
power (58&#176;&middot;2), and undergoes fermentation when mixed with yeast, and
reduces alkaline copper solutions, but in a different degree from
glucose.</p>

<p>Many of the substances frequently enumerated as being used
to adulterate sugar are at present very seldom employed. The
usual list includes &#8220;glucose&#8221; (often meaning invert
sugar), sand, flour, chalk, terra alba, etc. Loaf sugar is almost
invariably pure, although its colour is sometimes improved by the
addition of small proportions of various blue pigments, such as
ultramarine, indigo, and Prussian blue. The presence of ultramarine
was detected in about 73 per cent. of the samples of granulated
sugar tested in 1881 by the New York State Board of Health.
Tin salts<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a
href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> are also occasionally
employed in the bleaching <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>of sugar and syrups. Granulated sugar is
asserted to be sometimes mixed with grape sugar, and powdered sugar has
been found adulterated with flour and terra alba; but the varieties
which are most exposed to admixture are the low grades of yellow and
brown sugar, in which, however, several per cent. of invert sugar
are normally present. Sand, gravel, and mites form a rather common
contamination of raw sugar. From the year 1876 to 1881, 310 samples
of commercial sugar were examined by the public health authorities
of Canada, of which number 24 were reported as containing glucose,
and 11 as of doubtful purity. Of 38 samples of brown sugar recently
analysed by Dr. Charles Smart, of the National Board of Health, 9 were
adulterated with glucose. From the investigations of A. L. Colby,
Analyst to the New York State Board of Health, it was found that of the
116 samples examined, the white sugars were practically pure; whereas,
of 67 samples of brown sugar, 4 contained glucose. Of 16 specimens of
brown sugar, tested by a commission appointed by the National Academy
of Sciences in 1883, 4 contained about 30 per cent. of this body.<a

<p>It is stated that a large proportion of the American maple syrup and
maple sugar found on the market, consists of raw sugar, flavoured with
the essential oil of hickory-bark, for the manufacture of which letters
patent have been granted.</p>

<p><i>Analysis of Sugar.</i>&mdash;The examination of sugar is ordinarily
confined to the estimation of the water, ash, and determination
of the nature of the organic matters present. The proportion of
water contained in a sample is found by drying it for about two
hours in an air-bath, at a temperature of 110&#176;. Moist and syrupy
sugars, such as muscovadoes, are advantageously mixed with a known
weight of ignited sand before drying. The ash is determined either
by directly incinerating a few grammes of the sugar in a tared
platinum capsule, or by accelerating the process of combustion by
first moistening the sample with a little sulphuric acid. In this
case the bases will naturally be converted into sulphates, and a
deduction of one-tenth is usually made from the results so obtained,
in order to reduce it to terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110"
id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> of the corresponding carbonates. The
proportion of ash in raw cane sugar varies somewhat, but it should not
much exceed 1&middot;5 per cent. Its average composition, as given by Monier,
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Insoluble mineral adulterants are readily separated by dissolving
a rather considerable amount of the sample in water and filtering. In
this manner the presence of sand, terra alba, and foreign pigments may
be recognised.</p>

<p>The determination of the character of the organic constituents of
commercial sugars is effected, either by chemical or by physical tests,
and, in some instances, by a combination of these methods. The presence
of such adulterants, as flour or starch, is very easily detected upon a
microscopic examination of the suspected sample.</p>

<p>If cane sugar, containing grape sugar, is boiled with water, to
which about 2 per cent. of potassium hydroxide has been added, the
solution acquires a brown colour.</p>

<p>Upon mixing a solution of pure cane sugar with a solution of cupric
sulphate, adding an excess of potassium hydroxide, and boiling, only a
slight precipitation of red cupric oxide takes place. Under the same
conditions, grape sugar at once produces a copious green precipitate,
which ultimately changes to red, the supernatant fluid becoming nearly
or quite colourless. A very good method for the quantitative estimation
of grape sugar when mechanically mixed with cane sugar, is that of P.
Casamajor. It is executed by first preparing a saturated solution of
grape sugar in methylic alcohol. The sample to be tested is thoroughly
dried, and then well agitated with the methylic alcohol solution,
in which all cane sugar will dissolve;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> any grape sugar present
remains behind, and upon allowing the mixture to remain at rest for a
short time, forms a deposit which is again treated with the grape sugar
solution, and then collected upon a tared filter, washed with absolute
methylic alcohol, and weighed. Glucose and invert sugar are usually
quantitatively determined by means of Fehling&#8217;s solution.</p>

<p>As this preparation is liable to decompose upon keeping, it is
advisable to first prepare cupric sulphate solution by dissolving
exactly 34,640 grammes of the salt in 500 c.c. of distilled water,
and then make up the Rochelle salt solution by dissolving 68 grammes
of sodium hydroxide, and 173 grammes of Rochelle salt in 500 c.c.
of water, the solutions being kept separate. When required for use,
5 c.c. each of the copper and Rochelle solutions (corresponding to
10 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s solution) are introduced into a narrow
beaker, or a porcelain evaporating dish, a little water is added, and
the liquid brought to the boiling point. The sugar solution under
examination should not contain over 0&middot;5 per cent. of glucose. It is
cautiously added to the hot Fehling&#8217;s solution from a burette
until the fluid loses its blue colour (see p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a>). The number of c.c.
required to completely reduce 10 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s solution,
represents 0&middot;05 gramme of grape sugar. The foregoing volumetric
method is sometimes applied gravimetrically by adding a slight excess
of Fehling&#8217;s solution to the sugar solution, collecting the
precipitated cupric oxide upon a filter and weighing, after oxidation
with a few drops of nitric acid; or, it may be dissolved, and the
copper contained deposited by electrolysis, in which case the weight
of copper obtained, multiplied by 0&middot;538, gives the equivalent amount
of glucose. The proportion of cane sugar in a sample of raw sugar
can be determined by first directly estimating the proportion of
invert sugar contained by means of Fehling&#8217;s solution, as just
described. The cane sugar present is then inverted by dissolving one
gramme of the sample in about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112"
id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> 100 c.c. of water, adding 1 c.c. of
strong sulphuric acid, and heating the solution in the water-bath
for 30 minutes, the water lost by evaporation being from time to
time replaced. The free acid is next neutralised by a little sodium
carbonate, its volume made up to 200 c.c., and the invert sugar now
contained estimated by Fehling&#8217;s solution. The difference in the
two determinations represents the glucose formed by the conversion of
the cane sugar; 100 parts of the glucose so produced is equivalent to
95 parts of cane sugar.</p>

<p>Commercial cane sugar is, however, generally estimated by the
instrument known as the saccharimeter or polariscope.</p>

<p>In order to convey an intelligent idea of the physical laws which
govern the practical working of the polariscope, it will first be
necessary to refer to the subject of the polarisation of light. The
transformation of ordinary into polarised light is best effected
either by reflection from a glass plate at an angle of about 56&#176;,
or by what is known as double refraction. The former method can be
illustrated by Fig. 1, Plate X., which represents two tubes, B and
C, arranged so as to allow the one to be turned round within the
other. Two flat plates of glass, A and P, blackened at the backs, are
attached obliquely to the end of each tube at an angle of about 56&#176;,
as represented in the figure. The tube B, with its attached plate, A,
can be turned round in the tube C without changing the inclination of
the plate to a ray passing along the axis of the tube. If a candle be
now placed at I, the light will be reflected from the plate P through
the tube, and, owing to the particular angle of this plate, will
undergo a certain transformation in its nature, or, in other words,
become &#8220;polarised.&#8221; So long as the plate A retains the
position represented in the figure, the reflected ray would fall in the
same plane as that in which the polarisation of the ray took place,
and an image of the candle would be seen by an observer stationed at
O. But, suppose the tube B to be turned a quarter round; the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>plane
of reflection is now at right angles to that of polarisation, and
the image will become invisible. When the tube B is turned half-way
round, the candle is seen as brightly at first; at the third quadrant
it disappears, until, on completing the revolution of the tube, it
again becomes perfectly visible. It is evident that the ray reflected
from the glass plate P has acquired properties different from those
possessed by ordinary light, which would have been reflected by the
plate A in whatever direction it might have been turned.</p>

<p class="p1">If a ray of common light be made to pass through certain
crystals, such as calc spar, it undergoes double refraction, and
the light transmitted becomes polarised. The arrangement known as
Nicol&#8217;s prism, which consists of two prisms of calc spar, cut
at a certain angle and united together by means of Canada balsam,
is a very convenient means of obtaining polarised light. If two
Nicol&#8217;s prisms are placed in a similar position, one behind the
other, the light polarised by the first (or polarising) prism passes
through the second (or analysing) prism unchanged; but if the second
prism be turned until it crosses the first at a right angle, perfect
darkness ensues. While it would exceed the limits of this work to enter
fully upon the theoretical explanations which are commonly advanced
concerning the cause and nature of this polarised, or transformed
light, it may be well to state here that common light is assumed to
be composed of two systems of beams which vibrate in planes at right
angles to each other, whereas polarised light is regarded as consisting
of beams vibrating in a single plane only. If, now, we imagine the
second Nicol&#8217;s prism to be made up of a series of fibres or
lines, running only in one direction, these fibres would act like a
grating and give free passage to a surface like a knife blade only
when this is parallel to the bars, but would obstruct it if presented
transversely. This somewhat crude illustration will, perhaps, serve
to explain why the rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> of light which have been polarised by
the first Nicol&#8217;s prism are allowed to pass through the second
prism when the two are placed in a similar position, and why they
are obstructed when the prisms are crossed at right angles, it being
remembered that in a polarised ray the vibrations of the beams of light
take place in a single plane.</p>

<p>Suppose we place between the two Nicol&#8217;s prisms, while they
are at right angles, a plate cut in a peculiar manner from a crystal
of quartz, we will discover that rays of light now pass through the
second prism, and that the field of vision has become illuminated with
beautiful colours&mdash;red, yellow, green, blue, etc., according
to the thickness of the quartz plate used. On <em>turning</em> the second
Nicol&#8217;s prism on its axis, these colours will change and pass
through the regular prismatic series, from red to violet, or the
contrary, according to the direction of the rotation produced by
the intervening plate. Quartz, therefore, possesses the remarkable
property of rotating the plane of polarisation of the coloured rays of
which light is composed; and it has been discovered that some plates
of this mineral exert this power to the right, others to the left;
that is, they possess a right or left-handed circular polarisation.
Numerous other substances, including many organic compounds, possess
this quality of causing a rotation&mdash;either to the right or
left&mdash;of a plane of polarised light. For example, solutions
of cane sugar and ordinary glucose cause a right-handed rotation,
whilst levulose and invert sugar exert a left-handed rotation. The
extent of this power is directly proportional to the concentration
of the solutions used, the length of the column through which the
ray of polarised light passes being the same. It follows that on
passing polarised light through tubes of the same length which are
filled with solutions containing different quantities of impure cane
sugar, an estimation of the amount of pure cane sugar contained in
the tubes can be made by determining the degree of right-handed
rotation produced; and it is upon this fact<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> that the application
of the polariscope in sugar analysis is based. The optical portions
of the most improved form of the polariscope&mdash;that known as the
Ventzke-Scheibler&mdash;are represented by Fig. 2.</p>

<p>The light from a gas burner enters at the extremity of the
instrument and first passes through the &#8220;regulator A,&#8221;
which consists of the double refracting Nicol&#8217;s prism <i>a</i> and
the quartz plate <i>b</i>, it being so arranged that it can be turned round
its own plane, thus varying the tint of the light used, so as to best
neutralise that possessed by the sugar solution to be examined. The
incident ray now penetrates the polarising Nicol&#8217;s prism B, and
next meets a double quartz plate C (3&middot;75 millimetres in thickness).
This quartz plate, a front view of which is also shown in the figure,
is divided in the field of vision, one half consisting of quartz
rotating to the right hand, the other half of the variety which rotates
to the left hand. It is made of the thickness referred to owing to the
fact that it then imparts a very sensitive tint (purple) to polarised
light, and one that passes very suddenly into red or blue when the
rotation of the ray is changed. Since the plate C is composed of halves
which exert opposite rotary powers, these will assume different colours
upon altering the rotation of the ray. After leaving the double quartz
plate the light, which, owing to its passage through the Nicol&#8217;s
prism B is now polarised, enters the tube D containing the solution of
cane sugar under examination; this causes it to undergo a right-handed
rotation. It next meets the &#8220;compensator&#8221; E, consisting of
a quartz plate <i>c</i>, which has a right-handed rotary power, and the two
quartz prisms <i>d</i>, both of which are cut in a wedge shape and exert
a left-handed rotation. They are so arranged that one is movable and
can be made to slide along the other, which is fixed, thus causing an
increase or decrease in their combined thickness and rotary effect.
The ray of light then passes through the analysing Nicol&#8217;s prism
F, and is finally examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> by means of the telescope G, with the
objective <i>e</i> and ocular <i>f</i>. Fig. 3 gives a perspective view of the
Ventzke-Scheibler polariscope. The Nicol&#8217;s prism and quartz plate
which constitute the &#8220;regulator&#8221; are situated at A and B,
and can be rotated by means of a pinion connecting with the button
L. The polarising Nicol&#8217;s prism is placed at C, and the double
quartz plate at D. The receptacle <i>h</i> contains the tube P filled with
sugar solution, and is provided with the hinged cover <i>h&acute;</i>, which
serves to keep out the external light while an observation is being
taken. The right-handed quartz plate and the wedge-shaped quartz
prisms (corresponding to <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, Fig. 2) are situated at G, and
at E and F, and the analysing Nicol&#8217;s prism is placed at H. When
the wedge-shaped prisms have an equal thickness coinciding with that
of the quartz plate <i>c</i> (Fig. 2) the left-handed rotary power of the
former is exactly neutralised by the right-handed rotary power of the
latter, and the field of vision seen at I is uniform in colour, the
opposing rotary powers of the two halves of the double quartz plates
C (Fig. 2) being also equalised. But if the tube, filled with a sugar
solution, is placed in the instrument, the right-handed rotary power
of this substance is added to that half of the double quartz plate
which exerts the same rotary effect (the other half being diminished
in a like degree), and the two divisions of the plate will now appear
of different colours. In order to restore an equilibrium of colour
the movable wedge-shaped quartz plate E is slid along its fellow F
by means of the ratchet M, until the right-handed rotary power of
the sugar solution is compensated for by the increased thickness of
the left-handed plate, when the sections of the plate C will again
appear uniform in colour. For the purpose of measuring the extent
to which the unfixed plate has been moved, a small ivory scale is
attached to this plate, and passes along an index scale connected
with the fixed plate. The degrees marked on the scale, which are
divided into tenths, are read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117"
id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> by aid of a mirror <i>s</i> attached to a
magnifying glass K. When the polariscope is in what may be termed a
state of equilibrium, <i>i. e.</i> before the tube containing the sugar
solution has been placed in it, the index of the fixed scale points to
the zero of the movable scale.</p>

<p>In the practical use of the Ventzke-Scheibler saccharimeter the
method to be followed is essentially as follows: 26&middot;048 grammes of
the sugar to be tested are carefully weighed out and introduced into
a flask 100 cubic centimetres in capacity; water is added, and the
flask shaken until all crystals are dissolved. The solution is next
decolorised by means of basic plumbic acetate, its volume made up to
100 cubic centimetres, and a little bone-black having been added if
necessary, a glass tube, corresponding to P (Fig. 3) which is exactly
200 millimetres in length, and is provided with suitable caps, is
completely filled with the clear filtered liquid. This is then placed
in the polariscope, and protected from external light by closing the
cover shown at <i>h&acute;</i>. On now observing the field of vision by means of
the telescope, it will be seen that the halves into which it is divided
exhibit different colours. The screw M is then turned to the right
until this is no longer the case, and absolute uniformity of colour is
restored to the divisions of the double quartz plate C (Fig. 2). The
extent to which the screw has been turned, which corresponds to the
right-handed rotation caused by the sugar solution, is now ascertained
on reading the scale by the aid of the glass K. The instrument under
consideration is so constructed that, when solutions and tubes of the
concentration and length referred to above are used, the reading on the
scale gives directly the percentage of pure crystallisable cane sugar
contained in the sample examined. For instance, if the zero index of
the fixed scale points to 96&#176;&middot;5 on the movable scale, after uniformity
of colour has been obtained, the sample of sugar taken contains 96&middot;5
per cent. of pure cane sugar. The results given by the polariscope<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
possess an accuracy rarely, if ever, attained by any other apparatus
employed in the determination of practical commercial values.<a

class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The proportion of grape sugar intentionally added to cane sugar can
also be determined by the use of the polariscope, certain modifications
being observed in its application. As previously stated, cane sugar is
converted into a mixture of dextrose and levulose, termed invert sugar,
by the action of dilute acids. While the rotary effect of dextrose
upon the plane of a ray of polarised light is constant at temperatures
under 100&#176;, that exerted by levulose varies, it being reduced as
the temperature is increased; hence it follows that at a certain
temperature the diminished levo-rotary power of the levulose will
become neutralised by the dextro-rotary effect of the dextrose, <i>i.e.</i>
the invert sugar will be optically inactive. This temperature has been
found to approximate 90&#176;. Since dextrose is not perceptibly affected by
the action of weak acids, it is evident that by converting cane sugar
into invert sugar and examining the product by the polariscope at a
temperature of about 90&#176;, the presence of any added dextrose (glucose)
will be directly revealed by its dextro-rotary action. This is
accomplished by a method suggested by Messrs. Chandler and Ricketts,<a
name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which consists in substituting for the
ordinary observation tube of the polariscope a platinum tube, provided
with a thermometer, and surrounded by a water-bath, which is heated to
the desired temperature by a gas burner (Plate X. Fig. 4). The sugar
solution to be examined is first treated with a little dilute sulphuric
acid, then neutralised with sodium carbonate, clarified by means of
basic plumbic acetate, filtered, and the polariscopic reading taken at
a temperature of 86&#176; to 90&#176;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the results given by the foregoing method represent pure
dextrose, it is necessary to first ascertain the dextro-rotary
power of the particular variety of glucose probably employed for
the adulteration of the sugar under examination, and then make the
requisite correction. This process for the estimation of glucose is
especially advantageous, in that the optical effect of the invert sugar
normally present in raw cane sugars is rendered inactive.</p>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to determine the relative proportions
of the organic constituents which are present in commercial glucose.
These usually consist of dextrose, maltose, and dextrine, all of
which possess dextro-rotary power, but not in the same degree; that
of dextrose being 52, that of maltose 139, and that of dextrine 193.
An estimation of the amount of each can be made by first ascertaining
the total rotary effect of the sample by means of the polariscope.<a
name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This is expressed by the equation</p>

<p class="center">P = 52 <i>d</i> + 139 <i>m</i> + 193 <i>d&prime;</i>,</p>

<p class="v-none rt">(1)</p>

<p>in which P is the total rotation observed. Upon now treating the
solution of glucose with an excess of an alkaline solution of mercuric
cyanide (prepared by dissolving 120 grammes of mercuric cyanide and 25
grammes of potassium hydroxide in 1 litre of water), the dextrose and
maltose contained in the sample are decomposed, leaving the dextrine
unaffected. A second polariscopic reading is then made, which gives the
amount of dextrine present, that is</p>

<p class="center">P&prime; = 193 <i>d&prime;</i>,</p>

<p class="v-none rt">(2)</p>

<p>from which the proportion of dextrine is calculated.</p>

<p>Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have</p>

<p class="center">P - P&prime; = 52 <i>d</i> + 139 <i>m</i>.</p>

<p class="v-none rt">(3)</p>

<p>Both dextrose and maltose reduce Fehling&#8217;s solution,<span

total reduction (R) being the reducing per cent. of the former (<i>d</i>)
added to that of the latter (<i>m</i>). The reducing power of maltose is,
however, only 0&middot;62 as compared with dextrine, therefore</p>

<p class="center">R = <i>d</i> + 0&middot;62 <i>m</i>.</p>

<p class="v-none rt">(4)</p>

<p>Multiplying by 52, we have</p>

<h2>HONEY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Honey</span> consists of the saccharine
substance collected by the bee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apis mellifica</i>) from the nectaries of
flowers, and deposited by them in the cells of the comb. &#8220;Virgin
honey&#8221; is the product of hives that have not previously swarmed,
which is allowed to drain from the comb; the inferior varieties being
obtained by the application of heat and pressure. As a result of the
peculiar conditions of its formation, honey constitutes a rather
complex mixture of several bodies; indeed, its exact composition is a
matter of some doubt. The chief ingredients are levulose and dextrose,
accompanied by a small amount of cane sugar, and inconsiderable
proportions of pollen, wax, and mineral matter. According to Dubrunfaut
and Soubeiran,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a
href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> genuine honey contains
an excess of levulose mixed with dextrose and some cane sugar. In the
course of time the latter is gradually converted into invert sugar,
and a crystalline deposit of dextrose forms, the levulose remaining
fluid.</p>

<p>The substances said to be employed in the adulteration of
honey are water, starch, cane sugar, and glucose-syrup; the
last mentioned is undoubtedly most commonly used. Hager<a
name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> states that, by treating corn starch with
oxalic acid, a product is obtained which, on standing two or three
weeks, acquires the appearance and taste of genuine honey; and samples
of commercial honey not unfrequently wholly consist of this or some
other form of artificial glucose. The season for the collection of
honey by bees is a limited one, and any existing deficiency in their
natural source of supply is sometimes remedied by placing vessels
filled with glucose near the hives. Occasionally the bees are also
supplied with a ready-made comb, consisting, at least partially, of
paraffine. It has been asserted that in some<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> instances, this
factitious comb is entirely composed of paraffine, but the writer is
informed that, if the sophistication is practised to a proportion of
over 10 per cent., the bees do not readily deposit the honey in the
comb.</p>

<p>Owing to the complex composition of honey and to the rather
incomplete character of the analyses of the genuine article at hand,
the detection of some of the forms of adulteration resorted to is a
matter of considerable difficulty. The presence of starch is best
recognised by the microscopic examination of the honey. This will
likewise reveal the absence of pollen, which may be regarded as
a certain indication of the spurious nature of the sample. There
appears to exist a difference of opinion in regard to the presence
of cane sugar in genuine honey, but it may safely be accepted that
the detection of a considerable proportion of this substance points
to its artificial addition. In all cases of suspected adulteration
with cane sugar or glucose, the determination of the sugar present
by means of the polariscope and by Fehling&#8217;s method (both
before and after inversion) is indispensable. It is commonly stated
that unsophisticated honey polarises to the left, and that a sample
possessing a dextro-rotary action is necessarily contaminated with
glucose or cane sugar; but, while in the great majority of cases this
is doubtless the fact, it is equally certain that honey of known purity
has been met with which polarised to the right. Upon the inversion
of honey containing cane sugar, the dextro-rotation is changed to a
levo-rotation.</p>

<p>According to Lenz,<a name="FNanchor_65_65"
id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65"
class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the specific gravity (at 17&#176;) of
a solution of 30 grammes of pure honey in exactly twice the
quantity of distilled water is never less than 1&middot;1110, a
lower density indicating adulteration with water. Hehner<a
name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> states that the ash of genuine honey
is always alkaline, whereas that of artificial glucose is
invariably neutral. The proportion of phosphoric acid present
in honey varies from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>0&middot;013 to 0&middot;035 per cent., which is
considerably less than the proportion contained in starch sugars. Honey
contaminated with starch sugar will generally show about 0&middot;10 per
cent. of phosphoric acid, and artificial honey, made from cane sugar,
will usually be free from the acid.</p>

<p>The addition of commercial glucose may often be detected by the
turbidity produced upon adding ammonium oxalate to a filtered aqueous
solution of the sample; this is due to the presence of calcium
sulphate, a common impurity in the commercial varieties of glucose.
If the glucose employed for admixture contains much dextrine, as is
very often the case, this fact can be utilised in its detection as
follows:&mdash;2 c.c. of a 25 per cent. solution of the honey are
introduced into a narrow glass cylinder, and 0&middot;5 c.c. of absolute
alcohol is cautiously added; with pure honey, the point of contact of
the liquids will remain clear or become so upon allowing the mixture
to stand at rest, whereas in presence of artificial glucose a milky
turbidity will appear between the two strata. Genuine honey may, it
is true, contain a small proportion of dextrine and exhibit a slight
cloudiness when treated with alcohol, but the difference in the degree
of turbidity caused is very considerable, and sufficient to render the
test of service.</p>

<p>The test may also be applied by dissolving 20 grammes of the
suspected honey in 60 c.c. of distilled water and then adding an
excess of alcohol. Under these circumstances pure honey merely becomes
milky, while, if commercial glucose is present, a white precipitate of
dextrine is formed, which can be collected and weighed. If the sugar in
the sample is determined by Fehling&#8217;s solution, both before and
after inversion with a little sulphuric acid, and an estimation of the
amount of dextrine present is made by precipitation with alcohol, it
often occurs that the quantity of the latter substance is proportional
to the difference between the amount of sugar found.</p>

<p>According to the late investigations of Sieben,<a
name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> fairly <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>satisfactory methods for
the detection and determination of glucose syrup in honey are based
upon the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. When genuine honey undergoes fermentation, the substances which
remain undecomposed, are optically inactive. Glucose, or starch syrup,
on the other hand, leaves a considerable amount of dextrine, which
is strongly dextrogyrate. The test is made by dissolving 25 grammes
of honey in about 160 c.c. of water, and adding 12 grammes of yeast
(free from starch). The mixture is allowed to ferment at a moderate
temperature for two or three days, after which aluminium hydroxide is
added, and the liquid made up to 250 c.c. and then filtered. 200 c.c.
of the filtrate are evaporated to a volume of 50 c.c., and a 200 mm.
tube is then filled with the concentrated solution and examined by the
polariscope.</p>

<p>2nd. The substances remaining unaffected by the fermentation of pure
honey are not converted into a reducing sugar by boiling with dilute
hydrochloric acid, as is the case with those obtained from starch syrup
under the same circumstances. 25 c.c. of the solution employed for the
polarisation test, as just described, are diluted with an equal volume
of water, 5 c.c. of strong hydrochloric acid added, and the mixture
is placed in a flask and heated for an hour over the water-bath. The
contents of the flask are neutralised with potassium hydroxide, then
diluted to a volume of 100 c.c., and the proportion of reducing sugar
estimated in 25 c.c. of the solution. Honey containing different
proportions of starch sugar gave the following percentages of reducing
sugar:&mdash;</p>

<p>3rd. If the cane sugar originally present in genuine honey has
been changed into invert sugar, and the honey<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> solution is boiled with
a slight excess of Fehling&#8217;s reagent, no substances capable of
yielding sugar when treated with acids will remain undecomposed. Starch
syrup, when subjected to this treatment, yields grape sugar in about
the proportion of 40 parts to every 100 parts of the syrup used. The
test is applied as follows:&mdash;14 grammes of honey are dissolved in
450 c.c. of water, and the solution is heated over the steam-bath with
20 c.c. of semi-normal acid, in order to invert the cane sugar present.
After heating for half an hour, the solution is neutralised, and its
volume made up to 500 c.c. 100 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s solution are
then titrated with this solution, which may contain about 2 per cent.
of invert sugar (in case the sample examined is pure, from 23 to 26
c.c. will be required); 100 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s reagent are next
boiled with 0&middot;5 c.c. less of the honey solution than was found to be
necessary to completely reduce the copper. The reduced liquid is then
passed through an asbestos filter, the residue washed with hot water,
the filtrate treated with a slight excess of concentrated hydrochloric
acid, and the solution heated for one hour on the steam-bath. Sodium
hydroxide is now added, until only a very little free acid remains
unneutralised, and the solution is made up to 200 c.c. Upon well
shaking the cooled liquid, a deposit of tartar sometimes separates.
150 c.c. of the filtered solution are finally boiled with a mixture
of 120 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s reagent and 20 c.c. of water, and
the proportion of grape sugar estimated from the amount of metallic
copper obtained. (See p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>.) When pure honey is submitted to the
preceding process, the copper found will not exceed 2 milligrammes.
The quantities of copper obtained when honey adulterated with various
proportions of starch sugar was tested were about as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The detection of paraffine in honeycomb is easily accomplished.
Genuine bees&#8217;-wax fuses at 64&#176;, paraffine usually at a lower
temperature. The latter is not affected by treatment with concentrated
sulphuric acid, whereas bees&#8217;-wax is dissolved by the strong
acid, and undergoes carbonisation upon the application of heat. The
amount of potassium hydroxide required for the saponification of one
gramme of bees&#8217;-wax, as applied in Koettstorfer&#8217;s method
for butter analysis (p. 71), widely differs from the quantities
consumed by Japanese wax and paraffine. Mr. Edward W. Martin has

<h2>CONFECTIONERY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Pure</span> white candy should consist entirely
of cane sugar with its water of crystallisation, but most of the
article commonly met with contains a large proportion of glucose,
and in many cases it is wholly composed of this compound (see p.
109). Starch and terra alba (<i>i. e.</i> gypsum or kaolin), are the other
adulterants sometimes employed to fraudulently increase the bulk and
weight of candy.</p>

<p>The substances used for colouring purposes are more liable to
be positively deleterious. While such colouring agents as caramel,
turmeric, litmus, saffron, beet-juice, indigo, and some of the coal-tar
dyes may be considered comparatively harmless, there can be no question
in regard to the very objectionable character of certain other pigments
which are sometimes employed: these are mainly inorganic, and include
plumbic chromate, salts of copper and arsenic, zinc-white, barium
sulphate and Prussian blue. Another occasional form of adulteration
to which some kinds of confectionery are exposed, is the admixture of
artificial flavourings, such as &#8220;pear essence&#8221; (amylic
and ethylic acetates), &#8220;banana essence&#8221; (a mixture of
amylic acetate and ethylic butyrate), and oil of bitter almonds, or
its imitation, nitro-benzole. A preparation known as &#8220;rock and
rye drops,&#8221; which had acquired a great popularity among school
children in several of our large cities, proved upon analysis to
consist of a mixture of glucose, flour, and fusel oil.</p>

<p>The examination of candy and other forms of confectionery usually
embraces the determinations of glucose, starch, flour, colouring and
flavouring agents, terra alba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> and mineral admixtures generally. The
detection and estimation of glucose has already been described under
Sugar.</p>

<p>Starch and flour are readily detected upon treating a minute portion
of the suspected candy with a little water and submitting the mixture
to a microscopic examination, when, in their presence, the insoluble
residue will exhibit the characteristic forms of starch granules. The
insoluble portion of the sample may also be tested with a solution
of iodine. The proportion of starch can be determined by boiling the
matter insoluble in water with dilute sulphuric acid, and estimating
the amount of glucose found, by means of Fehling&#8217;s solution.</p>

<p>Coal-tar and vegetable compounds used for colouring purposes, can
often, be recognised by means of their behaviour with reducing and
oxidising agents, by their solubility in spirits and other menstrua,
and by the application of dyeing-tests. Thus vegetable colours may
sometimes be identified upon boiling mordanted cotton yarn in a bath
prepared from a portion of the sample containing the colouring matter,
and slightly acidulated with acetic acid. This process will likewise
generally reveal the presence of aniline dyes, unmordanted woollen
cloth being substituted for cotton, and a neutral bath being employed.
The inorganic pigments used for colouring candy are usually to be
sought for in the ash obtained upon incineration.</p>

<p>The presence of copper and lead is detected by the formation of
black precipitates upon saturating with sulphuretted hydrogen the
solution of the ash in hydrochloric acid; zinc, chromium, etc., are
precipitated from the filtered solution upon addition of ammonium
hydroxide and ammonium sulphide. It is frequently more convenient to
apply special tests for the particular metal thought to be present,
either directly to the pigment or to the ash. In this way, arsenic
can often be recognised by treating a portion<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> of the colouring matter
in a test-tube, when it will sublime and collect upon the cool part
of the tube in minute crystals of arsenious acid. Or, an acidulated
solution of the detached pigments may be boiled with a piece of
polished copper-foil, upon which the arsenic will be deposited as a
greyish film: this can be sublimed, and otherwise further examined.</p>

<p>Copper is easily detected and estimated by placing the acid solution
of the ash in a tared platinum dish, and reducing the copper by the
electrolytic method. Chromium is recognised upon boiling the colouring
matter with potassium carbonate solution: in its presence, potassium
chromate is formed, which is submitted to the usual distinctive tests
for chromium. The colour of Prussian blue is destroyed upon warming
it with caustic alkalies: indigo, which remains unaffected by this
treatment, forms a blue solution if heated with concentrated sulphuric
acid. The presence of terra alba, barium sulphate, etc., is best
detected by the examination of the ash. Chalk, or marble-dust, is
recognised by its effervescence when treated with an acid, as well as
by the presence of a notable proportion of lime in the ash.</p>

<p>Many of the flavouring mixtures added to candy may be separated
by treating the sample with chloroform or petroleum naphtha and
evaporating the solution to dryness over a water-bath, when their
identity is frequently revealed by their odour and other physical
properties. Of 198 samples of the cheaper varieties of confectionery
examined by Health officials in the United States, 115 were
adulterated. Plumbic chromate is a very common addition; 41 out of 48
samples of yellow- and orange-coloured candy contained this poisonous
pigment.</p>

<h2>BEER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name beer is most commonly applied
to a fermented infusion of malted barley, flavoured with hops. Its
manufacture embraces two distinct operations, <i>viz.</i>, malting and
brewing. Briefly considered, the former process consists in first
steeping barley (the seed of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hordeum distichon</i>) in water and
allowing it to germinate by arranging it in layers or heaps which are
subsequently spread out and repeatedly turned over, the germination
being thereby retarded; it is afterwards entirely checked by drying the
grain (now known as <em>malt</em>) in cylinders or kilns.</p>

<p>The degree of temperature employed in drying and roasting the barley
determines the colour and commercial character of the malt, which may
be pale, amber, brown or black. In the United States the light-coloured
varieties of malt are chiefly made. An important change which takes
place during the malting of barley is the conversion of its albuminous
constituents into a peculiar ferment, termed <em>diastase</em>, which,
although its proportion in malt does not exceed 0&middot;003 per cent., exerts
a very energetic action in transforming starch, first into dextrine,
then into sugar (maltose). The following analyses, by Proust, exhibit
the general composition of unmalted and malted barley:&mdash;</p>

<p>The body termed hordeine is generally considered to be an allotropic
modification of starch.</p>

<p>In the brewing of beer, the malted grain is crushed by means of
iron rollers, and then introduced into the mash-tubs and digested with
water at a temperature of about 75&#176;, whereby the conversion of the
starch into dextrine and sugar is effected. After standing for a few
hours, the clear infusion, or <em>wort</em>, is drawn off and boiled with hops
(the female flower of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Humulus lupulus</i>), after which it is rapidly
cooled, and then placed in capacious vats where it is mixed with
yeast and allowed to undergo the process of fermentation for several
days, during which the formation of fresh quantities of yeast and a
partial decomposition of the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid take
place. The beer is next separated from the yeast and transferred into
clearing-vats, and, later on, into storage casks, where it undergoes
a slow after-fermentation, at the completion of which it is ready for
consumption. The quality of the water used in the process of mashing
and brewing is of great importance, and it is of special moment that it
should be free from all organic contaminations. The presence of certain
mineral ingredients, notably of calcium sulphate, is believed to exert
a beneficial effect on the character of the beer obtained.</p>

<p>In the United States, the best known varieties of malt liquors are
ale, porter, and lager beer. The difference between ale and porter is
mainly due to the quality of the malt used in their manufacture. Ale
is made from pale malt, porter or stout from a mixture of the darker
coloured malts, the method of fermentation employed being in both
cases that known as the &#8220;superficial&#8221; (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">oberg&auml;hrung</i>),
which takes place at a higher temperature and is of shorter duration
than the &#8220;sedimentary&#8221; (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">unterg&auml;hrung</i>). The latter form
of fermentation, which is used in the preparation of Bavarian or
lager beer, occurs at a temperature of about 8&#176;, and requires more
time for its completion, during which the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> beer is, or should be,
preserved in cool cellars for several months before it is fit for use;
hence the common American name of this kind of beer, from <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">lager</i>, a
storehouse. There are three varieties of Bavarian beer, &#8220;lager
beer&#8221; proper, or the summer beer, which has been stored for
about five months; &#8220;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schenk</i>,&#8221; or winter beer, which is
fit for use in several weeks; and &#8220;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bock</i>&#8221; beer, which
possesses more strength than the former, and is made in comparatively
small quantities in the spring of the year. A mild kind of malt liquor,
known as &#8220;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">weiss</i>&#8221; beer, and prepared by a quick process of
fermentation, is less frequently met with.</p>

<p>The first brewery in America is said to have been founded in New
York in the year 1644, by Jacobus, who afterwards became the first
burgomaster of the city, then New Amsterdam. Subsequently, William
Penn established a brewery in Bucks Co., Pa., and a century later,
General Putnam engaged in the manufacture of beer in the State of
Connecticut. The brewing of lager beer in the United States began
to assume prominence about thirty-five years ago. It is estimated
that, at the present time, over 2000 breweries are devoted to the
preparation of this form of malt liquor, with an invested capital of
at least 60 millions of dollars, the annual production exceeding 15
millions of barrels.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a
href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The industry is
chiefly carried on in New York, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, St.
Louis, and Cincinnati.</p>

<p>The composition of beer naturally varies according to the kind
of grain from which it is made and the process of fermentation
employed. The chief ingredients are alcohol, carbonic acid, sugar
(maltose), dextrine, the oil and bitter principle of hops (lupuline),
albuminoids, lactic, acetic, succinic and propionic acids, inorganic
salts, and traces of glycerine. The term &#8220;extract&#8221; is
applied to the non-volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"
id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> constituents, which include the sugar,
dextrine, albuminoids, ash, etc. The foregoing table, collated from the
analyses of various chemists, gives the general composition of some
of the best known brands of malt liquor, as well as the minimum and
maximum proportions that have been found.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, normal beer consists solely of the product
of malt and hops, and the presence of any ingredients other than
these should be regarded as an adulteration. It is maintained by
brewers, and with justice, that the term &#8220;malt&#8221; is not
necessarily restricted to barley, but includes other varieties
of malted grain, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137"
id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> as wheat, corn, and rice. The old
English law, while permitting the addition of wholesome bitters,
prohibits the use of various other substances, but in the United
States, no legal definition of pure beer has, as yet, been formulated,
and the necessity for such a measure is being experienced.<a
name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The past literature of beer adulteration
makes mention of very numerous substances which, in former times, have
been resorted to as admixtures. Among these the following are the most
prominent:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. <i>Artificial bitters.</i>&mdash;Picric acid, picrotoxine, aloes,
gentian, quassia, and wormwood. Several years ago the author had
occasion to examine two samples, imported under the name of &#8220;hop
substitutes,&#8221; both of which proved to consist of <em>salicine</em>, the
bitter principle of the willow. The fruit of the hop tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ptelea
trifoliata</i>), has also been employed as an artificial bitter for
beer.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>Flavourings.</i>&mdash;For flavouring purposes, cayenne pepper,
&#8220;grains of paradise,&#8221; cloves, orris root, coriander seeds,
the oils of anise, nutmegs, and carraway, are stated to have been
used.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>Malt substitutes.</i>&mdash;These mainly consist of corn, rice,
and glucose.</p>

<p>A substitute for malt, of rather recent origin, and commercially
known as &#8220;cerealine,&#8221; is prepared by subjecting hulled and
coarsely ground Indian corn to the action of steam, the product being
subsequently pulverised by means of hot rollers. It is said to have the
following average composition:&mdash;</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, several chemical compounds, such as
ammonium carbonate, tartaric acid, alkaline phosphates, boric and
salicylic acids and glycerine are, or at least have been, employed
as accessories in the manufacture of beer. From the investigations
of the New York State Board of Health, it appears that the present
adulteration of American beer&mdash;more especially of &#8220;lager
beer&#8221;&mdash;is limited, so far as the brewer is concerned, to
the use of various substitutes for malt, the addition of salt, and of
sodium bicarbonate.</p>

<p>The proportion of diastase obtained by the germination of barley, or
other cereals, is largely in excess of the amount required to convert
into sugar the starch actually present in the grain treated; hence
the brewer can add other forms of amylaceous substances, such as corn
or rice, to malted barley with decided economy, and the majority of
New York brewers employ such substitutes, usually in a proportion of
25 per cent. The brewer may likewise advantageously add glucose syrup
to the malt infusion, since, by its use, he arrives at the same end,
<i>i. e.</i> instead of obtaining all of his sugar as the result of the
malting process, he directly provides himself with the same body, at
least so far as it possesses value to him as a source of alcohol. The
question of the sanitary effects of the use of artificial glucose as an
adulterant of sugar and syrups, and as a substitute for malted grain
in the manufacture of beer, has given rise to extensive controversy.
In this regard, one fact seems to have been demonstrated. Glucose,
as it is now to be found on the market, is free from any appreciable
amount of deleterious contamination. The discovery of its artificial
production has given birth to a very important branch of industry, and,
according to all available reports, the commercial product at present
met with is for many purposes an economical and harmless substitute for
cane sugar, the chief objection to its application as such being the
fact that it possesses considerably less sweetening power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The United States National Academy of Sciences, after
having carefully investigated the sanitary aspects of the
glucose question, arrived at the following conclusion:<a
name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a> &#8220;That, though having at best only
about two-thirds the sweetening power of cane sugar, yet starch sugar
is in no way inferior to the cane sugar in healthfulness, there being
no evidence before the committee that maize-starch sugar, either in
its normal condition or fermented, has any deleterious effect upon the
system, even when taken in large quantities.&#8221; In regard to the
use of glucose as a substitute for malt in beer-making, it is asserted
by some authorities that dietetic advantages to be derived from pure
malt will be to some extent wanting in the extractive matters of beer
manufactured partially from the artificial product. A distinction
between glucose and maltose, to the advantage of the latter, is also
made. The brewer, on the other hand, claims that sugar is sugar,
whether obtained from the malting of grain or from the conversion of
starch by the aid of acids. Regarding these bodies merely as sources
of alcohol, attempts to differentiate between them are of little
service. The superiority claimed for barley malt over its substitutes
would rather appear to be due to its greater richness in certain
soluble constituents, more especially those containing nitrogen and
phosphoric acid.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> A proposed law to
prohibit the use of all malt substitutes has recently been rejected
by the German Reichstag. In the English Beer Adulteration Act
(1886), however, it is directed that, in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>case beer (ale or porter)
made from other substances than hops and barley-malt is offered for
sale, the fact shall be mentioned on a prominent placard, stating the
nature of the foreign ingredients.</p>

<p>The addition of sodium bicarbonate is resorted to in order to
increase the effervescing power of the beverage, and, possibly
in some instances, to neutralise the acids formed by the souring
of new and hastily prepared beer.<a name="FNanchor_73_73"
id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> One of the chief objections to which
certain inferior varieties of American lager beer are open is that
they are not allowed to &#8220;age&#8221; properly. The apparent
gain to the brewer of such beer consists in an economy of time and
ice; he is also enabled to turn over his invested capital sooner
than the more scrupulous manufacturer, who is thus placed in a
disadvantageous position so far as trade competition is concerned.
It is stated that some of the beer made in the neighbourhood of New
York is sent out for consumption two weeks after its brewing.<a
name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Beer of this character would be apt to
contain abnormally large proportions of dextrine, dextrose, etc.,
as well as be contaminated with unchanged yeast and other products
of imperfect fermentation. It is said to be the practice to submit
it to a process of clarification by means of isinglass and cream of
tartar, and then impart additional life to the product by adding
sodium bicarbonate, which is used in the form of cartridges or pills,
and in a proportion of two ounces of the salt to the keg of beer.<a
name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Such a beverage obviously<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
possesses very little claim to the name &#8220;lager&#8221; beer.
It is, perhaps, to this reprehensible practice that many of the
deleterious effects on the digestive organs which sometimes follow the
consumption of considerable quantities of <em>poor grades</em> of lager beer
are to be ascribed; and it is often asserted to be the fact that beer
drinkers who have daily drunk from 20 to 25 glasses of German beer with
apparent impunity, experience disagreeable results from the habitual
consumption of much smaller quantities of some varieties of American
lager.</p>

<p>It should be remarked, in this connection, that the brewer is by
no means responsible for all of the sophistications to which beer is
exposed, as after it leaves his hands it may be watered by the retailer
as well as allowed to deteriorate in quality by careless methods of
preservation. From all procurable information, it would appear that the
only questionable features of beer brewing, as now generally carried on
in the United States, are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The use of corn and other meals, and of artificial glucose as
substitutes for malted barley.</p>

<p>2nd. The use of sodium bicarbonate, to impart additional life to the
beer, and the occasional use of common salt.</p>

<p>Concerning the alleged employment of artificial bitters in beer
it should be stated, that a few years since, when a very marked
increase occurred in the price of hops, other bitter preparations
were advertised and offered for sale in the market; unfortunately,
but little authentic data can be secured in regard to the extent of
their use. At present, this form of adulteration has apparently been
discontinued. It is worthy of notice, that the addition of hops to
beer was originally considered a falsification, and was prohibited
in England by legal enactments. In regard to the manufacture and
sale of partially fermented beer, the question of the prevalence
of this practice must be regarded as undetermined. No objection
exists to the proper use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> isinglass or other forms of gelatine for
the clarification of beer.</p>

<p>Of 476 samples of beer tested by Dr. F. E. Engelhardt, of the
New York State Board of Health, about one-quarter gave evidence of
the use of malt substitutes in their manufacture, but no sample was
conclusively shown to be adulterated with bitters other than hops.</p>

<p>The examination of beer properly includes an inspection of its
physical characteristics, such as taste, colour, and transparency, the
determination of the specific gravity, quantitative estimations of
the proportions of alcohol, carbonic acid, extractive matter, sugar,
organic acids, ash and phosphoric acid, and qualitative tests for
the detection of the presence of artificial substitutes for malt and
hops.</p>

<p>When of good quality, beer exhibits a bright and transparent colour,
a faint but not disagreeable aroma, and a clean and slightly bitter
taste. It should be free from any signs of viscosity, the appearance of
which is usually an indication of the presence of unchanged yeast.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of beer is determined by first removing the
excess of carbonic acid by repeatedly agitating the sample in a
capacious glass flask, or by pouring it from one beaker into another
several times, and then filling a specific gravity bottle with the
liquid and allowing it to stand at rest until all air or gas bubbles
have escaped; the weight of the bottle and its contents is now taken
at 15&#176;. In order to determine the proportion of alcohol present, 100
c.c. of the beer are introduced in a suitable flask which is connected
with a Liebig&#8217;s condenser and subjected to distillation until
about one-half of the quantity taken has passed over. The distillate
is then made up to its original volume by the addition of water, and
its density ascertained by means of the specific gravity bottle, from
which the percentage of alcohol present (by weight and by volume)
is readily obtained upon referring to the alcoholometric table<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> on
p. 144. The frothing of beer and the volatilisation of the free acids
present are best obviated by the addition of a little tannic acid and
baryta-water to the sample before the distillation. An indirect method
for the determination of alcohol in beer is also frequently employed.
It is accomplished by first ascertaining the density of the liquor,
next removing the alcohol present by evaporation over the water-bath,
subsequently adding sufficient water to restore the original volume and
again taking the specific gravity of the product. The density of spirit
of equal strength to the beer taken (X) is obtained by the formula,
<span class="division"><span class="numerator">D</span><span
class="denominator">D&acute;</span></span> = X, in which D is the original
gravity of the sample, and D&acute; the gravity of the de-alcoholised liquor
when made up to its first volume. The following table (see p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>)
from &#8216;Watts&#8217; Dictionary of Chemistry&#8217; gives the
percentages of alcohol by volume and weight, corresponding to different
densities at 15&#176;.</p>

<p>The amount of carbonic acid is conveniently found by introducing 100
c.c. of the <em>well-cooled</em> beer into a rather large flask, provided with
a delivery-tube which connects, first with a wash-bottle containing
concentrated sulphuric acid, next with a U-tube, filled with fused
calcium chloride. The latter is connected with a Liebig&#8217;s bulb
containing a solution of potassium hydroxide, then with a U-tube
containing solid potassium hydroxide, both of which have previously
been tared. The flask is heated over a water-bath until the evolution
of carbonic acid ceases, after which, the gas remaining in the
apparatus is caused to traverse the potash bulb by drawing air through
it. This is done by means of a tube attached to the flask and reaching
below the surface of the beer. At its other extremity, it is drawn
out to a fine point and connected with a small potash bulb (for the
retention of atmospheric carbonic acid), by aid of a rubber tube, which
permits of breaking the glass point before drawing air through the<span

apparatus. The amount of carbonic acid present in the sample is
ascertained by the increase of weight found in the larger potash bulb
and U-tube.</p>

<p>The sugar contained in beer is best determined by by taking 50
c.c. of the sample, adding 10 c.c. of plumbic basic acetate solution,
and making the volume of the mixture<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> up to 300 c.c. with
distilled water. After standing for some time the solution is passed
through a dry filter. It is then examined by cautiously adding it from
a burette to 10 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s solution (diluted with 40 c.c.
of distilled water and brought to the boiling-point), until the blue
colour of the latter disappears (see p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>). It should be borne in
mind that, while 10 c.c. of Fehling&#8217;s solution are reduced by
0&middot;05 gramme of glucose, it requires 0&middot;075 gramme of maltose to effect
the same reduction.</p>

<p>In order to estimate the dextrine, 10 c.c. of the beer are reduced
by evaporation to about 4 c.c., and heated with 1 c.c. of dilute
sulphuric acid to 110&#176; by means of an oil-bath in a strong hermetically
closed glass tube for five hours. At the completion of this operation
the solution is neutralised with sodium hydroxide, diluted, and the
total glucose determined by Fehling&#8217;s reagent, as just described.
The glucose due to the conversion of the dextrine is found by deducting
the amount of maltose (expressed in terms of glucose) previously
obtained from the total glucose; 10 parts of glucose represent 9 parts
of dextrine.</p>

<p>The organic acids (acetic and lactic) are estimated as
follows:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Acetic acid</i>, by distilling 100 c.c. of the
sample almost to dryness, and titrating the distillate with decinormal
soda solution; (<i>b</i>) <i>Lactic acid</i>, by dissolving the residue remaining
after the distillation in water, and either determining its acidity by
decinormal soda, or by treating the residue with water and a little
sulphuric acid, adding barium carbonate to the mixture, heating in
the water-bath and filtering, the precipitate being thoroughly washed
with hot water. The filtrate is then concentrated to a syrup by
evaporation, and agitated in a test-tube with a mixture of 1 part each
of sulphuric acid, alcohol, and water, and 10 parts of ether. After
standing at rest for some time, the ethereal solution is separated by
means of a pipette and evaporated to dryness in a tared capsule. The
residue (impure lactic acid) can be weighed, or it is dissolved in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
water, the solution treated with zinc carbonate, and the lactic acid
determined as zinc lactate, which contains 54&middot;5 per cent. of the
anhydrous acid.</p>

<p>Phosphoric acid may be estimated in the beer directly by first
expelling the carbonic acid, then adding a small quantity of potassium
acetate, heating, and titrating with a standard solution of uranium
acetate, using potassium ferrocyanide as the indicator. It can also be
determined gravimetrically in the ash.</p>

<p>The estimation of the ash is made by evaporating 100 c.c. of the
sample in a weighed platinum dish to dryness, and incinerating the
residue at a rather moderate heat, so as to avoid volatilisation of
the chlorides. The amount of ash in normal beer should never exceed
0&middot;5 per cent., the usual proportion being about 0&middot;3 per cent.; this
would naturally be increased by the addition of sodium bicarbonate
or sodium chloride to the beer. The complete analysis of the ash
is seldom necessary, but it is often of importance to estimate the
amount of sodium chloride contained. This is effected by dissolving
the ash-residue in distilled water and precipitating the chlorine
from an aliquot portion of the solution by silver nitrate; one part
of the precipitate obtained represents 0&middot;409 part of common salt. The
proportion of sodium chloride in pure beer is very inconsiderable,
but it may be added to the beverage either to improve the flavour or
to create thirst. For the determination of phosphoric acid, a weighed
portion of the ash is dissolved in nitric acid, the solution evaporated
to dryness, and the residue boiled with water containing a little
nitric acid. It is then filtered, concentrated by evaporation, an
excess of ammonium molybdate solution added, and the mixture set aside
for about ten hours, after which the precipitate formed is separated by
filtration and dissolved in ammonium hydroxide. A solution of magnesium
sulphate (mixed with a considerable quantity of ammonium chloride) is
now added, and the precipitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148"
id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> ammonio-magnesium phosphate collected,
washed, ignited, and weighed, 100 parts of this precipitate contain
64 parts of phosphoric anhydride (P<span class="sub">2</span>O<span
class="sub">5</span>).</p>

<p>The positive detection of the presence of artificial substitutes
for malt in beer is a matter of considerable difficulty. According
to Haarstick, a large proportion of commercial glucose contains
a substance termed <em>amylin</em>, which exerts a strong dextro-rotary
effect upon polarised light, but is not destroyed by fermentation,
and upon these facts is based a process for the identification
of starch-sugar in beer. It is executed by evaporating 1 litre
of the sample to the consistency of a syrup and separating the
dextrine present by the gradual addition of 95 per cent. alcohol.<a
name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a> After standing at rest for several hours the
liquid is filtered, the greater portion of the alcohol removed from
the filtrate by distillation, and the residual fluid evaporated to
dryness over the water-bath. The solid residue is then diluted to about
a litre, yeast added, and the sugar present decomposed by allowing
fermentation to take place for three or four days, at a temperature of
20&#176;. It was found that, under these conditions, pure beer afforded a
solution which was optically inactive when examined by the polariscope,
while beer prepared from artificial glucose gave a solution possessing
decided dextro-rotary power. The use of rice and glucose in the
manufacture of beer is also indicated when there is a deficiency in the
proportion of phosphoric acid in the ash, and of the extract, which
applies, although to a somewhat less extent, if wheat or corn meal has
been substituted for barley malt.</p>

<p>The following conclusions were reached by a commission of chemists
appointed in Germany to determine standards for beer:&mdash;A fixed
relation between the quantity of alcohol and extract in beer does
not invariably exist. As a rule in Bavarian and lager beer, for 1
part by weight of alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> a maximum of 2 parts and a minimum of
1&middot;5 parts of extract should be present. In case malt has been replaced
by glucose, or other non-nitrogenous substances, the percentage of
nitrogen in the extract will fall below 0&middot;65. The acidity should not
exceed 3 c.c. of normal alkali solution for 100 c.c. of beer. The ash
should not exceed 0&middot;3 per cent. The maximum proportion of glycerine
should not exceed 0&middot;25 per cent. For clarification, the following
means are permissible: Filtration, the use of shavings, etc., and of
isinglass or other forms of gelatine; for preservation, carbonic acid
gas, and salicylic acid may be employed&mdash;the latter, however, only
in beer which is intended for exportation to countries where its use is
not prohibited.</p>

<p>Several samples of so-called &#8220;beer preservatives&#8221;
examined by the author, consisted of a solution of sodium salicylate
and borax, dissolved in glycerine. Salicylic acid is employed in order
to prevent fermentation in beer, which is exposed to great variations
in temperature. Its presence is detected by the following process,
suggested by R&ouml;se,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a
href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> which is equally
applicable to wine:&mdash;The beer (or wine) is acidulated with
sulphuric acid, and well shaken with its own volume of a mixture
of equal parts of ether and petroleum naphtha. After standing at
rest, the ethereal layer is removed by a pipette, and evaporated
or distilled until reduced to a few c.c. A little water and a few
drops of a dilute ferric chloride solution are then added, and the
liquid filtered: in presence of salicylic acid, the filtrate will
exhibit a violet colour. In the case of wines, where the presence of
tannic acid might interfere with the salicylic acid reaction, the
filtrate is re-acidulated, then diluted, and the treatment with the
ether mixture and iron chloride repeated. The second residue will
now show the violet coloration, even in wines rich in tannin, and
containing but 0&middot;2 milligramme of salicylic acid per litre. The tannin
can also be removed by precipitation with <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>gelatine, and the colour
test for salicylic acid subsequently applied. Glycerine is likewise
sometimes used as a preservative of beer, and is also added to render
the liquor richer in appearance, by communicating a viscosity to the
froth which causes it to adhere longer to the sides of the glass. It
can be quantitatively estimated by evaporating 100 c.c. of the sample
in a capsule at a temperature of 75&#176;, until the carbonic acid has
been expelled, then adding about 5 grammes of magnesium hydroxide,
and thoroughly stirring the mixture until it forms a homogeneous,
semifluid mass. The contents of the dish are allowed to cool, and
are then well digested with 50 c.c. of absolute alcohol, and the
fluid portion afterwards separated by decantation, the residual
mass being again treated with 20 c.c. of absolute alcohol, and the
alcoholic solution thus obtained added to the first. The malose,
parapeptone, etc., present in the solution are now precipitated by
adding (with constant stirring) 300 c.c. of anhydrous ether, after
which the liquid is filtered, and the filtrate concentrated, at
first by spontaneous evaporation, subsequently by heating over the
water-bath, until it assumes the consistency of a syrup, when it is
placed in an exsiccator which connects with an air-pump, where it is
allowed to remain for twenty-four hours. The syrupy residue is then
digested with 20 c.c. of absolute alcohol and filtered, the filtrate
being collected in a tared capsule, which is again exposed to the
heat of the water-bath, and allowed to remain in the exsiccator for
twelve hours, after which it is weighed. The increase in weight gives
approximately the amount of glycerine contained in the beer examined.<a
name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"
class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>It is certain that many of the poisonous substances which in
former times have been detected in beer, such as strychnine,
hyoscyamine, picric acid, and picrotoxine, are not used at present.
It is much more probable that such bitters as gentian and quassia
may be met with, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> at times when hops are dear. These
latter far exceed hops in bitterness, and do not exert deleterious
effects upon health. Willow bark, or its active principle, salicine,
has also been employed. The detection of some of the most apocryphal
substitutes for hops is effected, according to Wiltstein,<a
name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a> by the following method: One litre of the
beer is concentrated over the water-bath to a syrupy liquor, which is
introduced into a rather capacious tared cylinder and weighed. The
gum, dextrine, and mineral salts are first separated by adding to the
syrup five times its weight of 95 per cent. alcohol, with which it is
thoroughly mixed, and allowed to digest for twenty-four hours. The
clear, supernatant solution is now drawn off, and the residue treated
with a fresh quantity of alcohol, which is afterwards united with the
solution first obtained, the whole being then evaporated until the
alcohol is expelled. A small portion of the residue is dissolved in a
little water, and tested for picric acid, as described later on. The
remainder is repeatedly shaken with about six times its weight of pure
benzol, which is subsequently removed by decantation, the operation
being then repeated with fresh benzol, the two solutions added and
evaporated to dryness at a very moderate temperature. The residue thus
obtained is divided into three portions, which are placed in small
porcelain dishes and tested as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To one portion a little nitric acid (sp. gr. 1&middot;330) is added; if
a red coloration ensues, <em>brucine</em> is present; if a violet colour,
<em>colchicine</em>. A second portion is treated with concentrated sulphuric
acid; the production of a red colour indicates the presence of
<em>colocynthine</em>. To a third portion, a few fragments of potassium
dichromate and a little sulphuric acid are added; if a purple-violet
coloration takes place, <em>strychnine</em> is present.</p>

<p>The portion of the syrup which has remained undissolved by benzol
is first dried over the water-bath, and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>then agitated with pure
amylic alcohol, by which treatment picrotoxine and aloes, if present,
will go in solution, and impart a bitter taste to the liquid.</p>

<p>The solution can be examined as subsequently directed for
picrotoxine; the presence of aloes is best recognised by the
characteristic saffron-like odour possessed by this body. The
syrup which remains after the successive treatments with benzol
and amylic alcohol is next freed from any remaining traces of the
latter compound by means of blotting-paper, and then thoroughly
agitated with anhydrous ether, which is afterwards removed and
allowed to spontaneously evaporate. If the residue now obtained
exhibits a wormwood-like aroma, and gives a reddish yellow solution,
which rapidly changes to a deep blue when treated with concentrated
sulphuric acid, <em>absinthine</em> is present. The syrup insoluble in
ether may still contain quassine, gentipicrine, and menyanthine, and
the presence of any of these bodies is indicated if it possesses a
bitter taste, since the bitter principle of hops would have been
removed by the foregoing treatment with solvents. The syrup is
dissolved in a little warm water, the solution filtered and divided
into two portions. To one a concentrated ammoniacal solution of
silver nitrate is added, and the mixture heated: if it remains clear,
quassine is probably present; the formation of a metallic mirror
points to the presence of either gentipicrine or menyanthine. A
second portion of the aqueous solution is cautiously evaporated in
a small porcelain capsule, and a few drops of strong sulphuric acid
are added to the residue: if no change takes place in the cold, but
upon applying heat a carmine-red coloration appears, <em>gentipicrine</em>
is present; if a yellowish brown colour, which afterwards changes to
a violet, is produced, the presence of <em>menyanthine</em> is probable.<a
name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p> <p>Picric acid can
be detected by means of the following tests:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Upon shaking pure beer with animal charcoal, it becomes
decolorised, whereas beer containing picric acid retains a lemon-yellow
colour after this treatment.</p>

<p>2. The bitter taste of normal beer is removed by treatment with a
little plumbic diacetate and filtering, which is not the case with the
flavour imparted by the use of picric acid.</p>

<p>3. Unbleached wool or pure flannel will acquire a decided yellow
colour if boiled for a short time in beer adulterated with picric acid,
and afterwards washed.</p>

<p>4. Upon agitating 20 c.c. of the suspected beer in a test-tube with
10 c.c. of amylic alcohol, allowing the mixture to remain at rest, and
then removing the amylic alcohol, a solution is obtained which contains
any picric acid present in the sample treated. It is evaporated to
dryness, the residue dissolved in a little warm distilled water, and
the aqueous solution submitted to the following tests:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To one portion a concentrated solution of potassium cyanide is
added; in presence of picric acid, a blood-red colour is produced, due
to the formation of iso-purpuric acid.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A second portion is treated with a solution of cupric-ammonium
sulphate; if picric acid be present, minute greenish crystals of
cupric-ammonium picrate will be formed.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To a third portion, a little ammonium sulphide, containing
free ammonium hydroxide, is added; in presence of picric acid,
picramic acid is produced, the formation of which is accelerated by
the application of heat, and is made evident by the appearance of an
intensely red colour.</p>

<p>The detection of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cocculus indicus</i>, or its poisonous alkaloid,
<em>picrotoxine</em>, may be effected by first agitating the beer with
plumbic acetate, filtering, removing the lead from the filtrate by
means of sulphuretted hydrogen, and again filtering. The filtrate
is first boiled, then carefully evaporated<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> until it possesses a
thickish consistency, when it is shaken up with animal charcoal, which
is afterwards brought upon a filter, washed with a very little cold
water, and dried at 100&#176;. The picrotoxine possibly present is then
extracted from the animal charcoal by boiling it with strong alcohol,
from which the alkaloid separates on evaporating the solution, either
in quadrilateral prisms or in feathery tufts.</p>

<p>Again reverting to beer adulteration, Prof. H. B. Cornwall
has lately made an interesting report in this regard.<a
name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Several years ago, in reply to a circular
issued by the &#8220;Business Men&#8217;s Moderation Society of
New York City,&#8221; the &#8220;Association of United Lager Beer
Brewers&#8221; asserted that the only substitutes for barley malt
employed were corn starch, corn meal, rice, glucose, and grape
sugar, no artificial bitters being used. The addition of glucose
and grape sugar, the association stated, was not necessarily on
account of economy, but had for its object an increase in the
strength of the wort, without resorting to concentration and the
production of beer of desirable flavour and colour. R&uuml;dlinger<a
name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> denies that beer is subjected to injurious
adulteration in Germany. He states substantially as follows:
&#8220;Cases of sickness, frequently claimed to be caused by the
beer, are due either to excess or to the consumption of the new and
incompletely fermented beverage. It has been affirmed that brewers
often economise in hops by the use of other and deleterious bitters,
and that picric acid and strychnine have been employed for this
purpose. Nonsense, once written, is frequently copied by hundreds,
and in this way circulates among the masses. The maximum amount of
hops used in beer is really inconsiderable, and, there exists no
necessity for resorting to foreign substitutes, even in seasons
when the price of hops is abnormally high, since the proportion
of this ingredient could <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>be slightly decreased without incurring
the danger of detection which would follow the use of artificial
bitters.&#8221; On the other hand, it is certain that, <em>in past
years</em>, such injurious additions as cocculus indicus, picric acid,
aloes, etc., have actually been discovered by chemists of high
standing in bitter ale and other forms of beer. A. Schmidt,<a
name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> asserts that glycerine, alum, and sodium
bicarbonate are added to beer, and states that beer, poor in extractive
and alcoholic constituents, is liable to become sour, a defect which is
remedied by the use of alkalies and chalk, the resulting disagreeable
taste being disguised by means of glycerine. The same authority
deprecates the use of glucose on account of the absence of nutritious
albuminoids and phosphates in this substance. It would certainly
appear obvious that the direct addition of starch-sugar to the wort,
which results in augmenting the alcoholic strength of beer without
correspondingly increasing the proportion of valuable extractive
matter, is of doubtful propriety. Grains are less open to this
objection. Of these, maize is generally regarded as the best substitute
for barley malt, both on account of its similarity in composition and
its cheapness. The International Congress of Medical Sciences, held at
Brussels in 1875, adopted the following resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Genuine beer should be made from grain and hops.</p>

<p>2. No other substances should replace these, either wholly or
partially.</p>

<p>3. All substitutes should be considered as adulterations, and
should come under the penalty of the law, even if not deleterious to
health.</p>

<p>The German Brewers&#8217; Association, at its Frankfort meeting,
defined wholesome beer as the produce of malt, hops, yeast, and
water with a partial substitution of the malt by starch meal,
rice, maize, and glucose, and regarded the use of some malt
substitutes as permissible on scientific and hygienic grounds. It
recommended, however, that, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>in case such substitutes are employed,
the beer so prepared should be designated by a distinctive name, such
as &#8220;rice beer,&#8221; &#8220;sugar beer,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>The darker varieties of beer are sometimes artificially
coloured by the addition of caramel, and, although the result
reached is virtually the same as that caused by the over-roasting
of malt, the practice is prohibited in Germany unless the
product is designated as &#8220;coloured beer.&#8221;<a
name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a> According to Guyot, some of the
Bavarian beer sold in Paris is coloured with methyl orange.<a
name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Licorice is employed in beer brewing in
Germany, both on account of its sweetening power and for clarifying
purposes.</p>

<p>In regard to the use of artificial preservatives, such as salicylic
acid and sodium bisulphite, it is very probable that articles of
food which have been treated with these preparations are not readily
digested. Their use, moreover, should be unnecessary, if due care has
been exercised in the manufacture of the beer. This is especially
applicable to beer intended for home consumption.</p>

<h2>WINE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Wine</span> is the fermented juice of the grape
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitis vinifera</i>. In its preparation, the fully matured grapes
are usually (but not always) first separated from the stalks, and
then crushed, the <em>marc</em> so obtained being afterwards placed in butts
provided with perforated sides, through which the expressed juice or
<em>must</em> percolates. It is next introduced into vats, and allowed to
undergo a process of fermentation, which is very analogous to that of
beer wort. The addition of yeast is, however, in this case unnecessary,
as the fermentation of grape-juice is spontaneous, it being due to
the generation of the fungus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Penicillium glaucum</i>, which is the
product of the action of atmospheric germs upon the albuminoid matters
contained in the must. The most important constituents of grape-juice
are glucose (10 to 30 per cent.), organic acids (0&middot;3 to 1&middot;5 per cent.),
and albuminous substances. During the fermentation the glucose is
converted into alcohol and carbonic acid, the latter being evolved in
bubbles; a deposit of potassium bitartrate and yeast-cells, forming
the <em>lees</em>, likewise occurring. This first fermentation ceases after
the lapse of several days, the period being indicated by the cessation
of escaping gas. In order to prevent the oxidation of the alcohol to
acetic acid, the liquid is removed from the lees and transferred into
casks, in which a slow after-fermentation and a further separation
of potassium bitartrate take place. The wine is subsequently
stored for a considerable time in fresh<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> casks, during which it
&#8220;ages,&#8221; and acquires its characteristic flavour.</p>

<p>The more common varieties of wine are classified according to the
country of their production&mdash;into French (claret, burgundy,
champagne, etc.), German (Rhine), Spanish (sherry and port), and
Italian.</p>

<p>The production of American wine has experienced a noteworthy
increase during the past twenty-five years. While, in 1860, less
than two millions of gallons of native wine were consumed in the
United States, in the year 1884 the quantity used exceeded seventeen
millions of gallons.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a
href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Aside from the
general distinction of red and white, wines are classified by their
characteristic properties, as dry, sweet, and cordial. In dry wines,
such as those of the Gironde and Rhenish districts, considerable free
acid, and but little or no sugar are contained, whereas in sweet
wines (Madeira, port, etc.) a certain proportion of the sugar remains
undecomposed. Cordial wines are distinguished by their sweetness
and comparatively heavy body. The nature of wines is materially
affected by the proportion of glucose and acids contained in the
original must, as well as by the environments of their manufacture,
such as climate and temperature. From a chemical point of view, the
most important constituents of wine are the primary products of
fermentation&mdash;alcohol, succinic acid, and glycerine, but its
market value is far more dependent upon the flavour and bouquet,
which are chiefly due to the formation of secondary products, usually
included under the name &#8220;oenanthic ether,&#8221; and consisting
of the ethers of caproic, caprylic, and other organic acids.</p>

<p>The following table exhibits the constituents of some of the best
known varieties of wine, according to results obtained by different
authorities:&mdash;</p>

<p>Natural wines are frequently subjected to various processes of
treatment, designed to remedy certain defects <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>existing in the original
must. While these do not, perhaps, all properly come under the head
of adulteration, it is certain that many of the practices resorted to
affect the dietetic quality of the wine in a deleterious manner. The
most common modes of treatment, generally considered harmless, are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pasteuring</i>, which consists essentially in heating the wine to
60&#176;, with a limited supply of air, and effects the artificial ageing
and better conservation of the product. Wines which exhibit ropiness
and other diseases are restored by destroying the fungi present. This
is accomplished by subjecting the well-filled and corked bottles to a
temperature of from 45&#176; to 100&#176; for several hours.</p>

<p>A process of freezing is likewise employed for the improvement
of wine. It results in the removal of much of the cream of tartar,
colouring matter, and nitrogenous substances contained, and also causes
an increase in the alcoholic strength of the wine, thereby considerably
decreasing its tendency to undergo an after-fermentation.</p>

<p>The proportions of sugar and acid best adapted to the production
of wine of good quality are at least 20 per cent. of the former to
not more than 0&middot;5 per cent. of the latter. As these conditions do
not always obtain in grape-juice, artificial methods are employed to
supply the necessary constituents. Of these, the most rational consists
in diluting the must until the amount of acid is reduced to 0&middot;5 per
cent., and increasing the sugar to a proportion of 20 per cent. by the
addition of glucose. In a somewhat similar process, due to Petiot, the
marc is repeatedly mixed with water containing 20 per cent. of sugar,
and then subjected to fermentation. In other methods, the removal of
the excess of free acid is effected by neutralisation with pulverised
marble or neutral potassium tartrate. The use of these agents results
in the formation and subsequent separation of insoluble salts&mdash;in
the latter case, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162"
id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> potassium bitartrate. Another process
for the improvement and preservation of natural wine, proposed by
Scheele, consists in the addition of glycerine, in a maximum proportion
of 3 per cent., after the first fermentation has taken place.</p>

<p>R. Kayser<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a
href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> has made a very
exhaustive investigation of wine-must of different sources, and of the
wine prepared therefrom, both in its natural state and after having
been subjected to various &#8220;processes of improvement.&#8221; The
following table shows the results obtained from the analysis of Franken
must and wine (both natural and &#8220;improved&#8221;), made from

<p><i>Adulteration of Wine.</i>&mdash;Although there may be some question in
regard to the moral status of the foregoing methods of improvement of
natural wine, numerous other practices are resorted to concerning which
no doubt can exist. The more common forms of wine adulteration include
plastering, sulphuring, fortification, blending, flavouring, colouring,
and the manufacture of fictitious imitations.</p>

<p>The &#8220;plastering&#8221; of wines consists in the addition of
plaster of Paris (often mixed with lime), either to the unpressed
grapes or to the must. The process, which is rather hypothetically
claimed to aid in the preservation of the wine and correct any
excessive acidity, is very objectionable, in that it determines the
formation of free sulphuric acid and acid sulphates, as well as
of calcium tartrate and potassium sulphate. The lime salt, being
insoluble, is deposited with the lees; the potassium sulphate, however,
remains in solution, and as it exerts a decided purgative effect, its
presence in wine cannot fail to be detrimental. In France, the sale of
wine containing over 0&middot;2 per cent. of potassium sulphate is prohibited.
The plastering of wine is chiefly carried on in Spain, Portugal, and
southern France. The ash of pure wine does not exceed 0&middot;3 per cent.,
but in the samples of sherry usually met with it reaches a proportion
of 0&middot;5 per cent., and is almost entirely composed of sulphates.
The &#8220;sulphuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&#8221; of wines is also extensively
practised. It is effected either by burning sulphur in the casks or
by conducting sulphurous acid through the wine itself, the object
sought being to preserve the product and impart to it the ripeness
naturally acquired by age. Sulphured wines, while not necessarily
showing an increase in the amount of ash, can often be recognised by
the abnormally large proportion of sulphates present.</p>

<p>The strength and preservative qualities of wine are frequently
augmented by the addition to it of inferior sorts of brandy. Port
wine usually receives an addition of about 30 per cent., and sherry
is invariably fortified, if not to so great an extent. By the Customs
regulations in England, 10 per cent. of brandy is allowed to be added
to wines in bond, while, in France, the sophistication is equally
permitted in wines intended for export, provided the total amount of
alcohol in the fortified article does not exceed 21 per cent.</p>

<p>Doubtless the mixing or blending of wines constitutes the most
frequent form of their sophistication. Natural wines of the same
manufacture vary to some extent from year to year in colour, flavour,
and other characteristic properties, and mixing is resorted to in
order to supply the trade with a product always possessing nearly
identical qualities. In many cases, the flavour of wines is improved
by blending, and their intoxicating effects are also increased, both
results being due to the formation of compound ethers. Common instances
of wine mixing are the addition of Hermitage and Rousillon wines to
clarets; of Malaga and Teneriffe to port; of <em>solaras</em> (a mixture of
Amontillado and Manzanilla) to sherry; and of a liqueur composed of
sugar, some kind of full, rich wine, and brandy, to champagne. The
flavour and bouquet of expensive wines are frequently imparted to
inferior grades by the addition of various substances, among which are
elderflowers, orris root, cherry water, essential oil of almonds,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sweet briar, and numerous perfumes, such as orange-flower water,
neroli, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">essence de petit grain</i>, violet petals, etc. The tincture
of raisin seeds is said to communicate a genuine port flavour to
poor wines, and a grain of ambergris, triturated with a little
sugar, is stated to impart a much esteemed bouquet to a hogshead of
claret. Numerous tinctures, as those of strawberry root, raspberries,
and walnuts, are likewise used. Sweet and liqueur wines are
extensively imitated at Cette and Montpelier. The following recipes<a
name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> will serve to illustrate the general
character of the mixtures employed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Port is frequently flavoured with a mixture of elderberry
juice, grape juice, brown sugar, and crude brandy known
as &#8220;<em>Jerupiga</em>.&#8221; Sherry often consists of
Cape wine mixed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166"
id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>with honey, bitter almonds, and
brandy. Astringency is conveyed to wines, deficient in this quality,
by means of tannin; and the property of forming a crust on the
interior of the bottle is produced, especially in port, by the
admixture of cream of tartar and gum. &#8220;Dryness&#8221; is
also obtained by artificial methods. A preparation met with in the
trade, and used for this purpose, has the following composition:<a

<p>The colour of white wines is caused by the oxidation of the
tannin present, but it is sometimes increased by the addition of the
concentrated juice of highly-coloured grapes, or by means of a small
proportion of caramel. The colour of natural red wine is due to the
presence of <em>oenocyanin</em>, a bluish-black compound, chiefly contained
in the grape skins, which is insoluble in water, but dissolves in
acidulated alcohol. In Spain and southern France, a wine prepared from
a vine known as the <em>Teinturier</em>, and possessing an intense bluish-red
colour, is extensively employed for colouring of wines. There appears
to be no doubt but that elderberries, black cherries, mulberries, and
hollyhock are also frequently used as colouring agents. Souberian<a
name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> mentions a mixture, termed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liqueur de
fismes</i>, composed of elderberries, but also containing about 5
per cent. of alum, which is occasionally employed. The general
use of several deleterious dyes, such as logwood, cochineal, and
the aniline colours, is far more problematical. In regard <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>to
the last-mentioned agents, it has, however, been asserted,<a
name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> that in a commune near Beziers, of 1800
inhabitants, magenta, to the value of 30,000 francs, is annually
consumed in the adulteration of wine.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of remark that an aniline preparation used
in Spain for the artificial colouring of wine has recently
been found to contain 1&middot;62 per cent. of arsenic acid.<a
name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the ravages of the phylloxera, a very considerable decrease
in the source of natural wines has taken place during the past few
years. Between 1883 and 1884 no less than 22 thousand acres of
vineyards were entirely destroyed in the Gironde district alone, and it
is stated, upon good authority, that the total production of wines in
France in 1884 was 220 millions of gallons less than the average of the
previous ten years.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a
href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> There is no doubt but
that this decrease has greatly stimulated the manufacture of imitation
wines. These occasionally contain a certain proportion of genuine wine
as the basis, but more frequently they consist entirely of factitious
constituents. The following recipe furnishes a fair example of those of
the first class:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is authentically stated that in the year 1881, 52 millions
of gallons of factitious claret wine were made in France, and the
industry has certainly not diminished in extent since this date. It
is a significant fact that the importation of Spanish raisins into
France has undergone a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>remarkable increase during the past
few years. Nor is this species of sophistication confined to foreign
wines. Establishments are in active operation in New York City
and elsewhere in this country, where imitations of Californian
hock and claret are made from fermented infusions of dried fruit
(often charged with salicylic acid), and offered for sale at less
than thirty cents per gallon, with more than the usual trade
discount.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a
href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> According to a
reliable estimation, less than one-tenth of the wine sold as champagne
is actually the product of that district, the remainder being
fabricated from other wines or from cider.</p>

<p><i>Analysis of Wine.</i>&mdash;The analysis of wine comprises the
following estimations:&mdash;Specific gravity, alcohol, extract,
sugar, polarisation, glycerine, total free acids, volatile acids, free
tartaric acid, potassium bitartrate, malic acid, succinic acid, tannin,
ethers, ash, chlorine, sulphuric and phosphoric acids, and colouring
matters.</p>

<p><i>Specific gravity.</i>&mdash;The density is determined by means of the
gravity bottle, at a temperature of 15&#176;.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol.</i>&mdash;The proportion of alcohol is ascertained by the
distillation of 50 or 100 c.c. of the wine in a suitable flask, which
is connected with a Liebig&#8217;s condenser, until about half of the
liquid has passed over. The distillate is made up to the original
volume with water, and its specific gravity taken, from which the
amount of alcohol (by weight) present is calculated by aid of the
usual alcohol-metric tables (see p. <a href="#Page_196">196</a>). The result (as well as
the proportions of the other constituents) is preferably stated in
grammes per 100 c.c. of wine. The determination may also be made by
first removing the alcohol by evaporation, adding distilled water
to restore the original volume, and then estimating the density
of the liquid (see under Beer, p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>). In unfortified wines the
alcoholic strength ranges <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170"
id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>from 6 to 12 per cent., and in wines
which have received an addition of spirit, it may vary from 12 to 22
per cent.</p>

<p><i>Extract.</i>&mdash;The extract is conveniently determined by
evaporating 50 c.c. (measured at 15&#176;), in a platinum dish over the
water-bath, the residue being dried for 2&frac12; hours in the
steam-oven. In case a wine rich in sugar (containing, say, over 0&middot;5
grammes per 100 c.c.) is under examination, 20 c.c. will suffice
for the determination. The indirect method used in the estimation
of the malt extract in beer may also be employed. According to
Girardin and Pressier, it is possible to detect the watering of
certain wines, the average composition of which is known, by means
of the proportions of extract and alcohol present. For example, in
genuine Bordeaux wines the proportion of extract ranges from 20 to
20&middot;8 grammes per 1000 c.c., and the amount of alcohol is also very
constant, it being a mean of 100 grammes per 1000 c.c. Should a
sample of Bordeaux wine show an extract of 14&middot;5 grammes per litre,
the proportion of genuine wine present would be 72&middot;5 per cent.,
for <span class="division"> <span class="numerator">1000 &times;
14&middot;5</span> <span class="denominator">20</span> </span> = 725&middot;00,
the remainder being water and alcohol. In order to estimate the
amount of spirits artificially added, the alcohol contained in 72&middot;5
parts of the wine is determined. If, for instance, it is found
to be 11 parts, then, (11 - 7&middot;25 = ) 3&middot;75 parts of alcohol have
been added.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a
href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The quantity of
extract in pure natural wine varies from 1&middot;5 to 3 per cent., but in
sweet and fortified wines, it may reach 10 per cent. or more.</p>

<p><i>Sugar.</i>&mdash;The sugar in wine consists of a mixture of fruit
and grape sugar, usually in the proportion of 3 parts of the former
to 1 part of the latter. The amount of sugar is best estimated
by Fehling&#8217;s solution (see p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>). In the case of white
wines, it is advisable to employ 100 c.c. for the determination;
with sweet rich wines 25 c.c. are sufficient. The alcohol is first
removed by evaporation over the water-bath, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>and the diluted liquid
is next decolorised by means of bone-black or plumbic acetate,
filtered, and made alkaline by addition of sodium carbonate. It is
then made up to a volume of 200 c.c. and gradually added to 10 c.c.
of Fehling&#8217;s solution. It is always well to test the wine
by the polariscope, and, whenever the presence of cane sugar is
indicated, to invert 100 c.c. of the sample by heating with a few
drops of hydrochloric acid, and again make a sugar determination with
Fehling&#8217;s reagent after neutralisation with sodium carbonate.</p>

<p><i>Polarisation.</i>&mdash;The optical examination of wine is conducted
by adding 20 c.c. of plumbic acetate solution to 100 c.c. of the
sample, shaking the mixture, allowing it to stand for a short time,
and passing it through a filter. If necessary the filtrate is further
decolorised with animal charcoal and again filtered. The polariscope
tube is then filled with the clear solution and the reading made. The
majority of wines exhibit a left-handed polarisation, which is due
to the fact that, as a rule, the proportion of fruit sugar present
predominates over that of grape sugar; moreover, &frac12; part of fruit
sugar will neutralise the dextro-rotary action of 1 part of grape
sugar. In case the presence of an excess of grape sugar is indicated by
the polariscopic examination, it is often assumed that this body has
been directly added to the wine. It sometimes occurs, however, that, in
the fermentation process, more grape sugar remains undecomposed than
fruit sugar, under which circumstances the preponderance of the former
body in the resulting wine would not prove sophistication; but, under
ordinary conditions, the presence of an excessive proportion of grape
sugar may safely be regarded as strongly pointing to the artificial
addition of must syrup.</p>

<p><i>Glycerine.</i>&mdash;100 c.c. of the wine are reduced by evaporation
on the water-bath to 10 c.c., some pure sand added, and then milk
of lime to decided alkaline reaction, after which the mixture
is evaporated nearly to dryness. When<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> cold, the residue is
thoroughly agitated with 50 c.c. of 96 per cent. alcohol, next heated
to boiling on the water-bath, and then passed through a filter.
The insoluble residue is repeatedly washed with more hot alcohol,
the washings being added to the first filtrate. The solution is
now evaporated until it assumes a viscous consistency. The residue
is taken up with 10 c.c. of absolute alcohol, and 15 c.c. of ether
are added, the mixture being shaken and allowed to stand at rest
in a well-stoppered flask until it becomes clear. The solution is
subsequently filtered into a tared glass capsule, then carefully
evaporated to a syrupy condition over the water-bath, and the residue
dried in the steam-oven for one hour, and finally weighed. According
to Pasteur, 112&middot;8 parts of grape sugar yield 3&middot;6 parts of glycerine;
in natural wine, therefore, the glycerine should amount to about <span
class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">14</span>th part of the
alcohol present.</p>

<p><i>Acids.</i>&mdash;The acids in wine consist of acetic, tartaric, malic,
tannic, succinic, racemic, formic, and propionic.</p>

<p><i>Total free Acids.</i>&mdash;These are determined by titrating 10
c.c. of the sample with <span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span
class="sub">10</span>th normal soda solution, litmus paper or
tincture of logwood being employed as the indicator. Wines containing
free carbonic acid should be repeatedly well-shaken before making
the estimation. The free acids are expressed in terms of tartaric
acid (C<span class="sub">4</span>H<span class="sub">6</span>O<span
class="sub">6</span>). If sulphuric acid or potassium bisulphate is
present, a piece of filter paper will be rendered brittle when immersed
in the wine for some time, and afterwards cautiously dried.</p>

<p><i>Volatile Acids.</i>&mdash;The volatile acids are estimated by slowly
evaporating 10 c.c. of the wine to the consistency of a syrup, and
repeating the titration with <span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span
class="sub">10</span>th normal alkali solution. The difference in
acidity represents the proportion of volatile acids present, which
is stated in terms of acetic acid (C<span class="sub">2</span>H<span
class="sub">4</span>O<span class="sub">2</span>). It is evident
that the non-volatile acids can be calculated by deducting from the
total amount of free acids, the tartaric acid corresponding to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> the
acetic acid found. The proportion of volatile acid in genuine wine
varies from 0&middot;3 to 0&middot;6 per cent. According to Dupr&eacute;, in white
wine, one-fourth of the total acidity should be due to volatile acids,
and in fortified and red wine, they should not exceed a proportion of
one-third.</p>

<p><i>Free Tartaric Acid and Potassium Bitartrate.</i>&mdash;In the presence
of a small amount of free acids, the detection of a considerable
proportion of free tartaric acid may fairly be considered as strong
evidence that the wine is artificial. Nessler recommends the following
qualitative test:&mdash;20 c.c. of the sample are repeatedly shaken
with a little freshly prepared and finely ground cream of tartar.
After standing one hour, the solution is filtered, 3 or 4 drops of a
20 per cent. solution of potassium acetate are added, and the mixture
is allowed to remain at rest for twelve hours, when, in presence of
free tartaric acid, a precipitation will take place. The quantitative
estimation of free tartaric acid and potassium bitartrate is made by
Berthelot&#8217;s method, as follows:&mdash;Separate portions of the
wine (20 c.c. each) are introduced into two flasks, a few drops of
20 per cent. solution of potassium acetate being added to the second
flask. 200 c.c. of a mixture of equal parts of alcohol and ether
are then added to both flasks, their contents repeatedly shaken and
finally set aside for eighteen hours at a temperature between 0&#176;
and 10&#176;. The separated precipitates are now removed by filtration,
washed with the ether-alcohol mixture, and then titrated with <span
class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">10</span>th normal alkali
solution. That formed in the first flask corresponds to the potassium
bitartrate originally contained in the wine; the second represents the
total tartaric acid present. The addition of a small quantity of clean
sand will assist in the separation of the precipitates.</p>

<p><i>Malic Acid.</i>&mdash;A slight excess of lime-water is added to
100 c.c. of the wine, and, after standing for some time the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
solution is filtered, concentrated by evaporation to one-half its
original volume, and treated with an excess of absolute alcohol. The
resulting precipitate (consisting of calcium malate and sulphate) is
collected upon a filter, dried and then incinerated. The proportion of
malic acid contained is now estimated by volumetrically determining
the amount of calcium carbonate present by means of a normal acid
solution: 1 part of calcium carbonate represents 1&middot;34 parts of malic
acid (C<span class="sub">4</span>H<span class="sub">6</span>O<span
class="sub">5</span>).</p>

<p><i>Tannic Acid.</i>&mdash;10 c.c. of the sample are taken, the free
acids present neutralised with normal alkali solution, and a few
drops of concentrated sodium acetate solution (40 per cent.) added.
A solution of ferric chloride (10 per cent.) is then added, drop by
drop, carefully avoiding an excess. A single drop of the iron solution
represents 0&middot;05 per cent. of tannic acid. The method of tannin
determination described under Tea (see p. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>) can also be applied.</p>

<p><i>Succinic Acid.</i>&mdash;500 c.c. of the wine are decolorised
with bone-black, filtered, the filtrate evaporated over the
water-bath nearly to dryness, and the residue repeatedly treated
with alcohol-ether. The solution thus obtained is concentrated,
carefully neutralised with lime-water, evaporated to dryness, and
the glycerine present removed by washing with the alcohol-ether
mixture. The remaining residue is now treated with 80 per cent.
alcohol, in order to dissolve the calcium succinate contained,
every 100 parts of which represent 75&middot;64 parts of succinic acid
(H<span class="sub">6</span>C<span class="sub">4</span>O<span
class="sub">4</span>). Thudichum and Dupr&eacute; state that one litre of
pure wine contains from 1 to 1&middot;5 grammes of succinic acid.</p>

<p><i>Ethers.</i>&mdash;The compound ethers in wine are volatile and fixed,
and exist in but minute proportions. Of the former class, ethylic
acetate C<span class="sub">2</span>H<span class="sub">3</span>(C<span
class="sub">2</span>H<span class="sub">5</span>)O<span
class="sub">2</span> is the most important. As already mentioned,
the aroma of wine is largely influenced by the presence of
the ethers of the fatty acids, butyric, caprylic, etc. Dupr&eacute;
determines the proportion of both kinds of ethers indirectly as
follows:&mdash;250 c.c. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"
id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> the wine are distilled until 200
c.c. have passed over. Water is then added to the distillate
to a volume of 250 c.c. 100 c.c. are first titrated with <span
class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">10</span>th normal soda
solution. Another 100 c.c. of the distillate are next heated with a
known quantity of alkali (by which the ethers are decomposed into
their corresponding acids and alcohol), and the titration is repeated.
The amount of <em>volatile</em> ethers is then calculated from the increased
acidity shown by the second titration. In order to determine the
proportion of <em>fixed</em> ethers, 500 c.c. of the sample are evaporated
over the water-bath to a small volume which is made alkaline, and then
subjected to distillation. The distillate is acidulated with sulphuric
acid and again distilled. The alcohol present in the second distillate
is now oxidised to acetic acid by means of potassium dichromate, and
the amount of this acid found estimated by titration. According to
Berthelot, the proportion of ethers in genuine wine bears a fixed
relation to the amounts of alcohol and acids present: he suggests the
following formula for calculating the amount of alcohol contained
in the compound ether of one litre of wine, when etherification is
complete:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>y</i> = 1&middot;17 A + 2&middot;8</p>

<p class="center"><i>x</i> = <span class="division">
  <span class="numerator"><i>y</i> &times; <i>a</i></span>
  <span class="denominator">100</span>
</span>,</p>

<p>where A is the percentage, by weight, of alcohol; <i>a</i> the amount
of alcohol equivalent to the total free acid in one litre of wine
(assuming this to be acetic acid); <i>y</i>, the proportion per cent. of
<i>a</i> present as compound ether in one litre of wine, when the alcoholic
strength of the wine is A; and <i>x</i>, the amount of alcohol present in
the compound ether of one litre of wine.</p>

<p><i>The Ash.</i>&mdash;100 c.c. of the wine are evaporated to dryness in a
platinum dish, over the water-bath, and the residue is incinerated at a
rather low temperature and weighed. By this process, the tartrates and
malates contained in the wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"
id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> are converted with carbonates. The
ash of normal wine consists of potassium sulphate, carbonate,
phosphate and chloride, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, etc.,
but, in many samples, it will be found to be largely if not entirely
composed of sulphates, which is due to the practice of sulphuring and
plastering.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a
href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Generally speaking,
the proportion of ash in genuine wine ranges from 0&middot;15 to 0&middot;30 per
cent.</p>

<p><i>Chlorine.</i>&mdash;100 c.c. of the sample are neutralised with sodium
carbonate, evaporated to dryness, and the residue gently ignited.
It is then extracted with boiling water, filtered, and the chlorine
determined by means of silver nitrate, either volumetrically or
gravimetrically.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric Acid.</i>&mdash;100 c.c. are acidulated with hydrochloric
acid, the liquid heated to boiling, and the sulphuric acid precipitated
by barium chloride. The precipitate is well washed, dried, and weighed.
100 parts represent 42&middot;49 parts H<span class="sub">2</span>SO<span
class="sub">4</span>. Pure wine contains from 0&middot;109 to 0&middot;328 gramme of
monohydrated sulphuric acid per litre (corresponding to 0&middot;194 to 0&middot;583
gramme potassium sulphate). The presence of an excess of this maximum
amount indicates that the wine has been plastered.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoric Acid.</i>&mdash;100 c.c. of the wine are evaporated,
the residue ignited, dissolved in a little water, acidulated with
nitric acid, and then added to an excess of solution of ammonium
molybdate. After standing over night the separated precipitate is
dissolved in ammonia and the phosphoric acid determined by means
of an ammoniacal solution of magnesium sulphate. 100 parts of the
precipitate thus obtained correspond to 63&middot;96 parts of phosphoric acid.
The former belief that the best qualities of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>wine contain the largest
proportion of phosphoric acid does not appear to be invariably
correct.</p>

<p><i>Salicylic Acid.</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103"
id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a>&mdash;The determination of this acid is
accomplished as follows:&mdash;100 c.c. of the sample are repeatedly
agitated with chloroform, which is subsequently separated and
evaporated to dryness. The residue is re-crystallised from chloroform
and weighed; its identity can be established by dissolving it in water
and adding solution of ferric chloride (see p. <a href="#Page_149">149</a>).</p>

<p><i>Sulphurous Acid.</i>&mdash;For the detection and estimation of
sulphurous acid, the following methods have been recommended:&mdash;500
c.c. of the wine are placed in a flask, the exit-tube of which
dips into a test-tube which is suitably cooled, and subjected to
distillation. When about 2 c.c. have distilled, a few drops of a
<em>neutral</em> solution of silver nitrate are added to the distillate:
in presence of sulphurous acid, a white curdy precipitate will
be formed, which differs from silver chloride in being soluble
in nitric acid. According to Haas,<a name="FNanchor_104_104"
id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104"
class="fnanchor">[104]</a> this test is not invariably decisive,
as pure wine may cause the precipitation under certain conditions;
moreover, acetic acid is said to render silver nitrate turbid in strong
alcoholic solutions. Sulphurous acid can be quantitatively determined
by adding phosphoric acid to 100 c.c. of the wine, and distilling it
in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas. The distillate is received in 5
c.c. of normal iodine solution. When one-third of the sample has passed
over, the distillate (which should still contain an excess of free
iodine), is acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and the sulphuric acid
formed precipitated with barium chloride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178"
id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p> <p><i>Colouring matters.</i>&mdash;Very
numerous processes have been published for the detection of foreign and
artificial colouring matters in wine. Among those suggested are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A few drops of the sample are placed in succession on the smooth
surface of a piece of white calcined lime, and notice taken of the
tint produced. The following colours are stated to occur with pure and
artificially coloured wine:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center tbl">

<p>2. If ammonium hydroxide be added to the suspected sample to
distinct alkaline reaction, then a little ammonium sulphide and the
liquid filtered, the filtrate from genuine wine will possess a green
tint, whereas that obtained from artificially coloured wine will
exhibit other colours, such as red, blue, violet, or brown.</p>

<p>3. 100 c.c. of the wine are evaporated to about one-half of the
original volume, ammonium hydroxide added to alkaline reaction, and
the liquid thoroughly shaken. Ether is then added, and the mixture
again well shaken. It is next introduced into a separator, and allowed
to stand at rest until the ether has risen to the surface, when the
lower stratum is drawn off, and the residual ether washed by agitation
with water, which is subsequently removed. The ethereal solution is
now transferred to a flask connected with a Liebig&#8217;s condenser,
a piece of white woollen yarn introduced into the liquid, and the
contents of the flask distilled at a gentle heat: in presence of the
smallest amount of fuchsine, the wool will acquire a very perceptible
reddish hue.</p>

<p>4. A slight excess of ammonium hydroxide is added to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> 50
c.c. of the wine, a piece of white woollen fabric introduced, and
the liquid boiled until the alcohol and ammonia are expelled. By
this treatment it will be found that most aniline colouring matters,
if present, become attached to the wool. Their presence can be
corroborated by removing the fabric, washing and pressing it, and then
dissolving it, with constant stirring, in a hot solution of potassium
hydroxide. When solution has taken place, the liquid is allowed to
cool, and one-half its volume of alcohol is added, then an equal volume
of ether. The mixture is vigorously shaken, and, after remaining at
rest for some time, the supernatant ethereal solution is removed,
introduced into a test-tube, and a drop or two of acetic acid added.
In presence of fuchsine, its characteristic colour will now become
apparent. Methyl violet and aniline blue are separated by an analogous
process.</p>

<p>5. Logwood and cochineal may be detected by agitating 100 c.c. of
the suspected wine with manganic peroxide, and filtering. The filtrate
afforded by pure wine will be colourless.</p>

<p>6. In Dupr&eacute;&#8217;s process,<a name="FNanchor_105_105"
id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> cubes of jelly are first prepared by
dissolving 1 part of gelatine in 20 parts of hot water, and pouring
the solution into moulds to set. These are immersed in the wine under
examination for 24 hours, then removed, slightly washed, and the depth
to which the colouring matter has permeated is observed: pure wine will
colour the gelatine very superficially; the majority of other colouring
principles (e.g. fuchsine, cochineal, logwood, Brazil wood, litmus,
beetroot, and indigo) penetrate the jelly more readily and to a far
greater degree. Dilute ammonium hydroxide dissolves from the stained
cake the colouring matter of logwood and cochineal, but not that
derived from fuchsine or beetroot.</p>

<p>7. The colouring principle of genuine wine when subjected <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>to
dialysis, does not pass through the animal membrane to any decided
extent, while that of logwood, cochineal, and Brazil wood easily
dialyses.</p>

<p>8. Many of the foreign dyes added to wine are precipitated by a
solution of basic plumbic acetate. The precipitate obtained upon
treating 10 c.c. of the sample with 3 c.c. of this reagent is collected
on a filter and washed with a 2 per cent. solution of potassium
carbonate, which dissolves cochineal, sulphindigotic acid and aniline
red. The latter is separated upon neutralising the solution with acetic
acid, and shaking with amylic alcohol, which, in its presence, will
acquire a rose colour. The liquid is next acidulated with sulphuric
acid, and again agitated with amylic alcohol, by which the carminamic
acid, originating from cochineal, is isolated. Any remaining indigo
(as well as the carminamic acid) is to be subsequently identified by
means of its spectroscopic reactions. Upon treating the portion of the
plumbic acetate precipitate which remains undissolved by potassium
carbonate with a dilute solution of ammonium sulphide, the colouring
matter of pure wine and of logwood is dissolved. If, in presence of
logwood, the original sample is shaken with calcium carbonate mixed
with a little calcium hydroxide solution and filtered, the filtrate
will exhibit a decided red tint, but, if the wine treated be pure,
little or no coloration will be produced.</p>

<p>9. An artificial colouring for wine, known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge
v&eacute;g&eacute;tale</i>, is not uncommonly employed. According to
Amthor,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a
href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> its presence can be
recognised as follows:&mdash;100 c.c. of the wine are distilled until
all alcohol is removed. The residual liquid is strongly acidulated
with sulphuric acid, and agitated with ether. Some woollen yarn is
next introduced into the ethereal solution, which is then evaporated
over the water-bath. In presence of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge v&eacute;g&eacute;tale</i>, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>the
wool will acquire a brick-red colour, which turns violet upon treatment
with ammonium hydroxide.</p>

<p>10. Cauzeneuve and Lepine<a name="FNanchor_107_107"
id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a> state that acid aniline red,
&#8220;naphthol-yellow S,&#8221; and roccelline red are harmless,
whereas safranine and ordinary Martius&#8217; yellow are decidedly
poisonous.</p>

<p>The presence of &#8220;Bordeaux red&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_108_108"
id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a> is recognised by first adding sodium
sulphate to the suspected wine, then a solution of barium chloride: the
artificial dye is carried down with the precipitated barium sulphate,
from which it can be extracted by means of sodium carbonate solution.
The brownish-red liquid thus obtained acquires a deep red colour if
acidulated with acetic acid, which it readily communicates to silk upon
boiling. Natural red wine fails to produce a coloration under the same
circumstances.</p>

<p>For the detection of the presence of artificial colouring matter
the following process is used in the Municipal Laboratory in
Paris:&mdash;Preliminary tests are made&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. By soaking pieces of chalk in an aqueous solution of
egg-albumen; these are dried and applied for use by dropping a little
of the wine upon them, and noting the coloration produced. Natural
coloured wine usually causes a greyish stain, which, in highly coloured
varieties, may verge to blue.</p>

<p>2nd. Baryta water is added to the wine under examination until
the mixture acquires a greenish hue, after which it is shaken with
acetic ether or amylic alcohol. If the wine be pure, the upper layer
remains colourless, even after acidulation with acetic acid; whereas,
in presence of <em>basic</em> coal-tar dyes, such as fuchsine, amidobenzole,
safranine, chrysoidine, chrysaniline, etc., characteristic colorations
will be obtained.</p>

<p>3rd. A few c.c. of the sample are made alkaline
by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>addition of dilute potassium hydroxide,
some mercuric acetate added, and the mixture agitated and filtered.
With pure wines, the filtrate is colourless; in the presence of <em>acid</em>
coal-tar derivatives, it is red or yellow.</p>

<p>The general character of the artificial dye contained in the wine
having been ascertained by the foregoing tests its more precise nature
is determined as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In case the foreign colouring is <em>basic</em>, the supernatant layer
obtained in the second test is separated, and divided into two
portions; one portion being evaporated with pure woollen yarn, the
other with filaments of silk. The dyed threads are then subjected to
the following tests:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Rose-aniline or safranine</i> affords a red coloration;
safranine usually attaches itself only on silk.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Soluble aniline violet</i> produces coloured threads which
become green upon treatment with hydrochloric acid, the primitive
colour reappearing upon dilution with water.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Mauve-aniline</i> gives a colour which turns blue upon addition
of the acid.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Chysotoluidine</i> causes a coloration which is only slightly
affected by the acid, but which is discharged upon boiling with zinc
powder; upon protracted exposure to the air the colour reappears.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Chrysoidine</i> and <i>Amidonitrobenzole</i> produce yellow
colours, the former turning poppy-red if treated with sulphuric acid,
the latter, scarlet. A general characteristic of dyes, similar to
rose-aniline, is that they are decolorised by treatment with sodium
bisulphite.</p>

<p>If the presence of an <em>acid</em> coal-tar dye is indicated by the third
preliminary test, the following special methods of procedure are
employed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two portions of the wine are saturated respectively with
hydrochloric acid and with ammonium hydroxide water, and each portion
is strongly agitated with acetic ether. The ethereal layers are
removed by means of a pipette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183"
id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> then mixed together, evaporated to
dryness, the residue obtained treated with a drop of concentrated
sulphuric acid, and observations made of the colour obtained:&mdash;</p>

<p>The method employed in the Paris Municipal Laboratory for the
detection of dried fruit wine, or of added commercial glucose, is
substantially the following:&mdash;A little beer-yeast is added to
300 c.c. of the suspected wine, and the mixture is allowed to undergo
fermentation at a temperature of about 30&#176;. When the fermentation is
completed, the filtered liquid is introduced into a dialyser, the outer
water of which is automatically renewed. The process of dialysis is
continued until the outer water ceases to show a rotary effect when
examined by the polariscope, after which it is neutralised with calcium
carbonate and evaporated to dryness over the water-bath, with constant
stirring. The residue obtained is treated with 50 c.c. of absolute
alcohol and filtered, the insoluble matters being twice washed with
25 c.c. of alcohol. The alcoholic filtrates are next decolorised by
means of animal charcoal, and evaporated to dryness, and the solid
residue is dissolved in 30 c.c. of water and polarised. Genuine claret,
when tested in this manner, fails to exhibit a rotary power, or is
but slightly dextrogyrate, whereas fruit wines, and those containing
artificial starch sugar, strongly rotate respectively to the left or to
the right.</p>

<p>The following are some of the conclusions arrived at by
a commission, appointed by the German Government, to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
inquire into uniform methods for wine analysis, and establish
standards of purity for genuine wine.<a name="FNanchor_109_109"
id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109"
class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) After deducting the non-volatile acids, the extract in natural
wine should amount to at least 1&middot;1 gramme per 100 c.c.; after deducting
the free acids, to at least 1 gramme per 100 c.c.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Most natural wines contain one part of ash to every 10 parts
of extract.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The free tartaric acid should not exceed <span
class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">6</span>th of the total
non-volatile acids.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The relation between the alcohol and glycerine varies in
natural wines between 100 parts alcohol to 7 parts glycerine, and 100
parts alcohol to 14 parts glycerine. These proportions do not apply,
however, to sweet wines.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Genuine wines seldom contain less than 0&middot;14 gramme of ash, nor
more than 0&middot;05 gramme of sodium chloride per 100 c.c.</p>

<p>According to the analyses of Moritz, the maximum and minimum
relative proportions of the constituents of natural wine are as
follows:&mdash;The extract (after deducting the free acids) ranges
from 1&middot;10 to 1&middot;78 per cent.; the proportion of ash to extract varies
from 1 : 19&middot;2 to 1 : 6&middot;4; that of phosphoric acid to ash ranges from
1 : 12&middot;3 to 1 : 10&middot;49; that of alcohol to glycerine, from 100 : 12&middot;3
to 100 : 7&middot;7.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a
href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> From the
investigations of Dr. Dupr&eacute;, it would appear that in genuine
unfortified wines, the amount of alcohol present varies from 6 to 12
per cent. by weight. A wine containing less than 6 per cent. would
be unpalatable, and more than 13 per cent. cannot well be present,
since natural grape-juice <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185"
id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>does not contain the quantity of sugar
requisite for the production of a greater amount of alcohol; moreover,
an excess of this proportion would retard, if not entirely stop, the
process of fermentation. Pure wines contain a greater proportion of
volatile than fixed ethers, but in fortified wines the reverse is
frequently the case. In natural wines, which are not over a few years
old, the sugar present rarely amounts to 1 per cent., generally it is
much less. Fortified wines, in which fermentation has been checked
by the addition of alcohol, often contain 5 per cent. of sugar;
champagnes usually show from 4 to 10 per cent., and, in some liqueur
wines, a maximum of 25 per cent. has been found. In natural wines, the
total dry residue generally ranges from 1&middot;5 to 3 per cent., while in
fortified wines the addition of sugar and other substances may increase
its proportion to 10 per cent., or even more. At the Paris Municipal
Laboratory the following standards are adopted: The amount of added
water in all wines, not sold as of a special or abnormal character, is
calculated on a basis of 12 per cent. of alcohol (by volume) and 24
grammes of dry extract per litre. The proportion of potassium sulphate
in unplastered wines must not exceed 0&middot;583 gramme per litre. The use of
salicylic acid is prohibited.</p>

<h2>LIQUORS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ordinary forms of liquors (namely,
whisky, rum, and gin), are prepared by the distillation of alcoholic
infusions. The process of distillation is preceded either by the
conversion of the amylaceous constituents of grain, first into sugar,
then into alcohol, or by the fermentation of saccharine bodies into
alcohol, or, as in the case of brandy, it may be directly applied to a
solution containing alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Brandy.</i>&mdash;When genuine, brandy is the product of the
distillation of various sorts of rich, light-coloured wines. The
most esteemed quality is prepared in the neighbourhood of Cognac, in
the Deux Charentes district, and in Armagnac; but numerous inferior
grades are manufactured in Rochelle and Bordeaux and in other parts
of Southern France, as well as in Spain and Portugal. In the United
States, a considerable quantity is produced by the distillation of
California and Ohio wine. The fermented marc and lees of grapes are
also extensively utilised in the manufacture of brandy. Most of the
liquor known in commerce under this name, however, is made from
the spirit obtained by the distillation of potatoes, corn, and
other grains, which is subsequently rectified, deodorised, and then
suitably flavoured. In France, the different grades of brandy are
known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie sup&eacute;rieure</i> (the best quality of Cognac);
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie ordinaire</i> (common, sp. gr. 0&middot;9476); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie de
marc</i> (chiefly used for mixing purposes); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie seconde</i> (weak
and inferior); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie &agrave; preuve de Hollande</i> (sp. gr.
0&middot;941); <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie &agrave; preuve d&#8217;huile</i> (sp. gr. 0&middot;9185);
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie forte</i> (sp. gr. 0&middot;8390); and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit-de-vin</i> (sp. gr.
0&middot;8610).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187"
id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristic taste and bouquet of the original wine are
to a considerable extent communicated to the resulting brandy, and
upon these qualities its value is greatly dependent. Many of the
remarks made in regard to the ageing, flavouring and blending of
wines equally apply to brandy, and need not be repeated in this
place. When freshly distilled, it is colourless, its amber tint
being either due to the casks in which it has been stored, or to
added caramel. The normal constituents of genuine brandy are water,
alcohol (including small amounts of butylic, propylic and amylic),
various ethers (acetic, oenanthic, butyric, and valerianic),
aldehyde, acetic and tannic acids, and traces of sugar and the
oil of wine. The specific gravity usually approximates 0&middot;9300
(equivalent to 52 per cent. of alcohol by volume), it may, however,
range from 0&middot;9134 to 0&middot;9381 (from 60 to 48 per cent. of alcohol).
Owing to the presence of acetic acid, genuine brandy usually shows a
slightly acid reaction. According to Blyth, the constituents vary as
follows:&mdash;total solids, from 1 to 1&middot;5 per cent.; ash, from &middot;04
to &middot;2 per cent.; acids (estimated as tartaric), from &middot;01 to &middot;05 per
cent.; sugar from 0 to &middot;4 per cent. A partial examination of brandy,
by K&ouml;nig,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a
href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> furnished the
following percentages:&mdash;specific gravity, 0&middot;8987; alcohol (by
weight), 61&middot;70; extract, 0&middot;645; ash, 0&middot;009. The ingredients found in
twenty-five samples of brandy tested for the New York State Board of
Health varied as follows:&mdash;specific gravity, 0&middot;9297 to 0&middot;9615;
alcohol (by weight) from 25&middot;39 to 42&middot;96; extract, from 0&middot;025 to 1&middot;795;
ash, from 0&middot;002 to 0&middot;014.</p>

<p>The majority of these samples were certainly abnormal
in composition. Ordonneau<a name="FNanchor_112_112"
id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> has quite recently determined by careful
fractional distillation the proportions of the more important
constituents of cognac brandy twenty-five years old, with the following
results, the quantities being stated in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>grammes per
hectolitre:&mdash;aldehyde, 3; ethylic acetate, 35; acetal, traces;
normal propylic alcohol, 40; normal butylic alcohol, 218&middot;6; amylic
alcohol, 83&middot;8; hexylic alcohol, 0&middot;6; heptylic alcohol, 1&middot;5; propionic,
butyric and caproic ethers, 3; oenanthic ether, 4; amines, traces.
The large proportions of normal butylic and amylic alcohols obtained
are very significant. It was found that commercial alcohol, prepared
from corn, potatoes and beetroot, while containing isobutylic alcohol,
was entirely free from normal butylic alcohol, and the difference
in flavour between genuine brandy and brandy distilled from grains
would appear to be mainly due to this fact. Normal butylic alcohol
is obtained when fermentation takes place under the influence of
elliptical or wine yeast, whereas the iso-alcohol is the product of
fermentation induced by means of beer yeast; and it was shown that, by
fermenting molasses, etc., with the aid of wine yeast, a spirit was
obtained which much resembled brandy in colour and flavour.</p>

<p><i>Whisky.</i>&mdash;Whisky is the spirituous liquor prepared by
distilling fermented infusions of barley, wheat, corn, and other
grains. Spirits that contain over 60 per cent. of alcohol are known
as &#8220;high wines,&#8221; or common spirits; those containing 90
per cent. of alcohol are often termed &#8220;cologne spirits,&#8221;
the name whisky being usually given to the product of a former
distillation, containing about 50 per cent. by weight of alcohol.
In Great Britain, the largest amount of whisky is made in Scotland
and Ireland; in the United States, the principal supply comes from
the States of Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky (Bourbon Co.), and
Pennsylvania (Monongahela Co.). The grains taken differ greatly
in composition. In Scotland and Ireland, malted barley (pure, or
mixed with other grain) is extensively employed; in the preparation
of Bourbon, partially malted corn and rye are taken, while, for
Monongahela whisky, only rye (with 10 per cent. of malt) is used. The
essential features of whisky-making are, first, the conversion<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the starch of the grain into dextrine and glucose, which takes
place in the process of <em>mashing</em>; the change being due to the
action of the nitrogenous principle, <em>diastase</em> (formed during the
germination of the gain); then, the transformation of the sugar into
alcohol and carbonic acid by fermentation, which is induced by the
addition of yeast; and, finally, the concentration of the alcohol by
distillation. The quality of whisky is much affected by the nature
of the grain from which it is prepared, and by the care exercised in
its manufacture, more particularly in the process of distillation.
The most injurious ingredient in distilled spirits is commonly known
as &#8220;fusel oil,&#8221; which term comprises several products of
alcoholic fermentation, possessing a higher boiling point than ethylic
alcohol, and consisting chiefly of amylic alcohol, accompanied by
small proportions of butylic and propylic alcohols. Several varieties
of fusel oil exhibiting distinctive properties are met with, but
that obtained from potato-spirit is the most common. As a rule, the
spirits prepared from malted grain contain the smallest proportion.
In the manufacture of whisky, a danger of promoting the formation of
fusel oil is incurred by carrying on the distillation to the furthest
point, in order to obtain the greatest possible quantity of alcohol.
In Great Britain, the fermented mash is removed from the remaining
grain before its introduction into the still; but in this country
the entire mash is occasionally taken, by which means a larger yield
of alcohol is supposed to be effected. This practice is evidently
open to the objection that the solid matters of the wort are liable
to suffer destructive distillation, and engenders the formation of
fusel oil. Another result, sometimes experienced, is the imparting of
a smoky flavour to the product, which was originally intentionally
communicated to the famous &#8220;poteen&#8221; whisky of Ireland, by
using malt dried by means of burning turf. This quality is said to
be still artificially obtained by the use of creosote. Genuine<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
whisky, when recently made, is nearly colourless; but, if preserved
in casks, it gradually acquires a brownish colour. It contains minute
quantities of tannic acid, and ethylic and amylic acetates and
valerianates. The specific gravity generally ranges between 0&middot;9220
and 0&middot;9040, corresponding to 48 and 56 per cent. of alcohol. The
solid extract in whisky is usually below 1 per cent., and the total
volatile acids under 0&middot;1 per cent. In regard to the average composition
of whisky, chemical literature furnishes but very meagre data. The
examination of a large number of samples of ordinary American whisky
in 1881, for the New York State Board of Health, gave the following
results:&mdash;Specific gravity ranged from 0&middot;9018 to 0&middot;9645; alcohol
(by weight) from 23&middot;75 to 52&middot;58; solid residue, from 0&middot;100 to 0&middot;752;
ash, from 0&middot;0020 to 0&middot;0280. Several samples of rye whisky, examined
by Mr. Green,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a
href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> showed alcohol (by
weight) from 32&middot;50 to 51&middot;20; tannic acid, 0&middot;0003; acetic acid, 0&middot;0012
to 0&middot;002; sugar, 0&middot;002 to 0&middot;005; solid residue, 0&middot;160 to 0&middot;734.</p>

<p><i>Rum.</i>&mdash;Rum is obtained by the distillation of the fermented
juice of sugar-cane or of molasses; a very considerable proportion
of the article bearing this name is, however, made from grain
spirit. In France and Germany the mother-liquor remaining after
the extraction of beet-sugar, is utilised in the manufacture of
a spirituous liquor greatly resembling rum in properties. The
characteristic odour and taste of the liquor are mainly due to
the presence of ethylic butyrate, and are frequently factitiously
communicated to its imitations by the direct addition of this ether
or of butyric acid. Grain spirit is also sometimes treated with
pineapples, which likewise impart the distinctive flavour. Rum is
chiefly produced in the West Indies, and in North America. The
specific gravity ranges from 0&middot;874 to 0&middot;926; alcohol, from 50 to 70
per cent.; solid residue, from 0&middot;7 to 1&middot;50 per cent; ash, under 0&middot;10
per cent.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a

<p>The variations in the composition of commercial rum would seem to be
so great that little information of value concerning its authenticity
is to be derived from analyses of a general character.</p>

<p><i>Gin.</i>&mdash;Genuine Holland gin is a spirit prepared by the
distillation of fermented grain infusions (rye and malted barley),
flavoured with juniper berries, or oil of turpentine. Formerly the
flavouring was directly introduced into the still together with the
mash, but the more recent practice is to add salt, water, and juniper
berries to the distilled grain spirit, and then re-distil the mixture.
Numerous other aromatic substances are likewise employed in the
manufacture of gin, among which are coriander, cardamom, and caraway
seeds, orris, angelica, and calamus roots, cassia, bitter-almonds,
sweet fennel, etc. Cayenne pepper, sugar, and acetic acid, are said
to be also frequently added to gin. Gin doubtless possesses more of
an artificial character than any other spirit. It is safe to assert
that the great bulk of the drink sold under the name is simply
grain-spirits flavoured with some of the preceding aromatics. On
the other hand, the flavouring agents employed are not, as a rule,
harmful in their effects, so that the quality of the liquor is mainly
dependent upon the extent to which the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>spirits used have been
rectified. It is difficult to define &#8220;pure gin,&#8221; since,
owing to its compound character, it varies in composition according
to the method of manufacture followed by each individual distiller.
The variations found from the examination of twenty-five samples of
the commercial article, tested by the New York State Board of Health,
were as follow:<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a

<p><i>Adulteration of liquors.</i>&mdash;Although it is notorious that
the more common varieties of spirituous liquors are sophisticated,
the practices resorted to are unfortunately usually of a character
that does not permit of positive detection, and, unless an actual
adulteration, such as the addition of some substance foreign to
the genuine liquor, has been made, a chemical examination alone
is frequently inadequate to distinguish between the true and the
factitious article. In fact, the ordinary physical qualities, such
as odour and taste, are often of greater service in determining the
genuineness of distilled spirits than more scientific tests. The most
prevalent form of sophistication with brandy, rum, and gin, is their
artificial imitations; the direct addition of substances deleterious
to health being of comparatively unfrequent occurrence. It is usual to
employ a certain proportion of the genuine liquor in the fabrication of
its imitation. An apparent objection to this species of adulteration is
that grain spirits are liable to be used as the basis of the fictitious
product, which is therefore apt to be contaminated with fusel oil, a
compound producing toxic effects in a proportion fifteen times greater
than ordinary ethylic alcohol.</p>

<p>In the United States, whisky is probably less subjected to
serious sophistication than other spirituous drinks. While <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>the
blending of this liquor (i. e. the mixing of new and old grades) is
almost universally practised by the refiner, and while the retail
dealer often reduces its alcoholic strength by the addition of water,
there is very little ground for the belief that, in this country,
whisky is subjected to noxious admixture to any great extent.</p>

<p>A very large number of recipes have been published for the
manufacture of spurious liquors; the following are characteristic, and
will indicate their general nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>The chemical examination of distilled spirits is ordinarily limited
to a determination of the alcohol, solid residue, ash, and volatile
acids, coupled with special qualitative and quantitative tests for any
particular adulterants, the presence of which may be suspected.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Alcohol.</i>&mdash;In properly distilled liquors, a fairly
approximate estimation of their alcoholic strength is effected by
the specific gravity determination, which is best made by means of
the special gravity bottle. In the case of spirituous liquors which
contain extractive matters, it is necessary to first separate the
alcohol present by the process of distillation, and then determine
the density of the distillate when made up to the volume originally
taken. The following table gives the percentages of alcohol by
weight and by volume, and of water by volume, for specific gravities
at 15&#176;.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a
href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The percentages of alcohol in the table are calculated for
the temperature of 15&#176;. The necessary correction for differences
of temperature at which the determination is made is obtained by
multiplying the number of degrees above or below 15&#176;, by 0&middot;4, and
adding the product to the percentage shown by the table, when the
temperature is lower than 15&#176;, and deducting it when it is above.</p>

c.c. of the liquor in a tared platinum dish, until constant weight is
obtained.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Ash.</i>&mdash;The proportion of ash is found by the
incineration of the solid residue. If the presence of poisonous
metallic adulterants (such as copper or lead) is suspected, a further
examination of the ash is necessary.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Acids.</i>&mdash;The acidity of distilled liquors is generally
due to minute quantities of acetic acid, and can be estimated by means
of <span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span class="sub">10</span>th
normal soda solution.</p>

<p>Any mineral acid (<i>e.g.</i>, sulphuric acid) supposed to be present
is to be sought for in the residue remaining, after the distillation
process employed in the determination of alcohol.</p>

<p>The presence of fusel oil in liquors is sometimes quite readily
detected, by first removing the ethylic alcohol by gentle evaporation,
and then inspecting the odour and taste of the still warm residue.
The suspected liquor may also be agitated with an equal volume
of ether, water added, and the ethereal stratum removed by means
of a pipette, and concentrated by evaporation; the residue is to
be examined for amylic alcohol. When distilled with a mixture of
sulphuric and acetic acids, amylic alcohol is converted into amylic
acetate, which may be recognised by its characteristic pear-like
odour; or, the amylic alcohol can be transformed into valerianic
acid (which also possesses a distinctive odour) by oxidation with
sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate. Another simple qualitative
test for fusel oil consists in first decolorising a small quantity
of the liquor under examination with animal charcoal, adding a few
drops of hydrochloric acid, and then a little freshly distilled and
colourless aniline oil, when, in presence of fusel oil, it will
be observed that the aniline compound acquires a perceptible rose
tint as it falls to the bottom of the liquid. The quantitative
determination of fusel oil presents some difficulties. A very ingenious
method has been suggested by Marquardt.<a name="FNanchor_118_118"
id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118"
class="fnanchor">[118]</a> It consists <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>essentially in first
agitating the sample with chloroform, draining off the solution
obtained, washing it by repeated shaking with water, and then
treating it at 85&#176; with a mixture of 5 parts potassium dichromate,
2 parts sulphuric acid, and 30 parts of water. The valerianic acid
thus formed is now separated by distilling the mixture of water and
chloroform. The distillate is digested with barium carbonate, next
concentrated by evaporation, and then filtered, and divided into two
equal portions. One portion is evaporated to dryness, the residue
taken up with water containing a little nitric acid, and the amount
of barium present determined by precipitation with sulphuric acid. In
the other portion, the chlorine originating from a partial oxidation
of the chloroform, is to be estimated. The amount of barium combined
with the chlorine, is deducted from the total quantity obtained; the
remainder represents the proportion in combination with the fatty acids
formed by oxidation. Of these, valerianic acid largely predominates;
and the amount of barium valerianate [Ba<span class="sub">2</span>
(C<span class="sub">2</span>H<span class="sub">3</span>O<span
class="sub">2</span>)] found is calculated to its equivalent in amylic
alcohol. Capsicum, creosote, etc., are isolated by treating the
sample with ether or benzole, and testing the odour and taste of the
evaporated solutions so prepared.</p>

<p>Creosote gives a blue colour with ferric chloride solution; and the
exceedingly pungent vapours evolved upon heating a residue containing
capsicum are equally characteristic. The presence of tannin in
distilled spirits, which is mostly derived from their preservation in
casks, is recognised by the formation of a bluish-black colour upon
the addition of ferric solutions. The identification of the various
ethylic and amylic ethers used in the preparation of factitious
liquors is a matter of some difficulty. Their presence is most readily
detected by means of their characteristic odour, which is developed
upon adding a little sodium hydroxide to the sample, evaporating
the mixture over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199"
id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> water-bath almost to dryness, and
then adding a small quantity of sulphuric acid. Another means of
ascertaining the nature of the organic ethers present in spirits is to
first remove the ethylic alcohol contained by a partial distillation
with an alkaline solution, and then acidulate the remaining liquid
with sulphuric acid, and repeat the distillation, when the volatile
fatty acids originally contained in the ethers will be found in the
distillate; their identity is to be established by means of their
characteristic properties. Nitrous ether (which compound is not
contained in genuine liquors) may be detected by partially distilling
the sample and adding a mixture of potassium iodide, starch paste, and
acetic acid to the first portion of the distillate, the production of
a blue colour indicating its presence. As previously remarked, the
exercise of the ordinary senses is frequently of greater value in
judging the quality of liquors than the results of chemical tests. Many
of the organic ethers employed in the manufacture of artificial liquors
are identical with those contained in the genuine article, and it is
obvious that, in such instances, no distinction can be made between
them.</p>

<h2>WATER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of the purity of potable
waters possesses the highest degree of importance in its sanitary
relations, and, particular attention has been bestowed upon methods of
analysis that would serve to indicate the character and significance
of existing impurities. The earlier processes of examination, which
chiefly consisted in the determination of the mineral constituents of
water, while of use in furnishing an idea of the general nature of
the water regarded as an inorganic solution, almost totally failed
to reveal the presence of the more subtle and important organic
contaminations which are now known to exert an active influence in the
propagation of zymotic diseases. During the past few years, decided
progress has been attained in the analytical methods employed. Little
is known of the exact nature of the organic constituents present in
water that has received sewage contamination. They may be either of
vegetable or animal origin, and it appears to be very probable that
they constitute organised germs. But, although we are still unable to
determine the constitution of these deleterious ingredients, it is at
present possible to approximately ascertain the hygienic character of
drinking water, and to distinguish, with a fair degree of accuracy,
between a good and a bad sample. In arriving at a conclusion regarding
the sanitary quality of water, it is, however, also needful to take
into consideration the origin and surrounding conditions which affect
the chances of contamination. Most of the more recent methods of water
analysis are based upon the fact, that the putrefactive decomposition
of harmful organic matter is attended by the genesis of certain<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
compounds (such as ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates), of which
quantitative estimations can be made. For the purpose of ascertaining
the character of a potable water, the following determinations are
usually necessary:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Colour, odour, and taste.</p>

<p>2. Total solid matter and loss on ignition.</p>

<p>3. Organic matter in solution.</p>

<p>4. Chlorine.</p>

<p>5. Ammonia, free and albuminoid.</p>

<p>6. Nitrogen, as nitrites and nitrates.</p>

<p>Certain precautions should be observed in the collection of samples
of water intended for examination. It is indispensable for this purpose
to employ scrupulously clean glass stoppered bottles, which are washed
out several times with the water previous to being filled. If a well
or stream is to be sampled, the bottle should be entirely immersed in
the water some distance from the sides of the stream, and, if taken
from a pump or pipe, the latter should be cleansed by first running a
considerable quantity of the water before charging the bottle.</p>

<p>1. <i>Colour, odour, and taste.</i>&mdash;The colour is best determined
by filling a glass cylinder, about 2 feet in height, with the sample,
placing it upon a white surface and observing the tint produced; or, by
the use of a coloured glass tube of the same length, which is provided
with glass plates attached at each end, and is filled with the sample
and viewed when held towards a sheet of white paper.</p>

<p>As a rule, pure water exhibits a light-bluish tint, a yellowish hue
being generally considered a suspicious indication; but it frequently
occurs that a perfectly colourless water is bad, and one possessing a
decided colour may prove to be at least, fair in quality. The odour
of the sample is ascertained by placing a corked bottle, one-half
filled with the water, in a warm place (at about 38&#176;) for some time,
and then shaking the bottle, withdrawing the stopper and immediately
testing the odour. Pure water should be free<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> from much perceptible
odour of any kind, and more especially from one of a disagreeable
nature. The same remark applies to the taste. Water should be
practically tasteless, even when warmed. It frequently happens,
however, that a water may be highly contaminated with deleterious
organic impurities, and still remain devoid of any marked unpleasant
taste. There are few simple tests of any value which will reveal at
once the sanitary quality of drinking water. One, sometimes employed,
is to fill a clean quart bottle about three-fourths full with the
suspected sample, and dissolve in it a teaspoonful of fine granulated
white sugar. The bottle is then corked and allowed to remain in a warm
place for two days, when, in the presence of sewage contamination,
it will become cloudy or milky.<a name="FNanchor_119_119"
id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a> According to Wanklyn and Chapman,<a
name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a
href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> if a brownish
colour or precipitate is produced upon the addition of 1&middot;5 c.c. of
Nessler&#8217;s reagent (see p. <a href="#Page_208">208</a>) to 100 c.c. of the water, it
should be considered unfit for domestic use.</p>

<p>2. <i>Total solid residue and loss on ignition.</i>&mdash;500 c.c. of
the water under examination are introduced, in small portions at a
time, into a tared platinum dish, and evaporated to dryness over the
water-bath, the residue being subsequently dried for three or four
hours in an air-bath at 100&#176;. The solid residue obtained, multiplied
by 200, represents parts in 100,000: or, by 140, grains per imperial
gallon. It is usually considered that, unless the proportion of
total solids exceeds 40 grains per Imperial gallon (32 grains per
U.S. gallon, or about 56&middot;5 parts per 100,000), the water need not be
objected to for drinking purposes on this ground alone. The volatile
and organic matters are determined by igniting the solid residue,
which is afterwards allowed to cool. It is then moistened with a
little carbonic acid water <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>or solution of ammonium carbonate, dried
to constancy at 130&#176;, and the organic matter estimated by the decrease
in weight. Formerly, this process was chiefly depended upon for
determining the proportion of organic substances contained in water.
It is open to numerous serious objections, among which are, that it
may afford a result either below or above that correctly representing
the quantity of organic ingredients present in the sample. The first
case takes place when a portion of the organic matter is decomposed
during the process of evaporation, and is quite liable to occur; the
second case takes place when the water contains nitrates, which would
be decomposed upon ignition. The method, however, possesses some value,
and is still often resorted to as affording a general idea of the
proportion of organic contamination present, the degree of blackening
of the solid residue during the process of ignition being, at least, a
useful qualitative indication.</p>

<p>3. <i>Organic matter in solution.</i>&mdash;A method frequently
employed for this determination is based upon the supposition that
the amount of potassium permanganate required to oxidise the organic
constituents contained in water would serve as a criterion of its
sanitary value. It is generally known as the &#8220;Forchammer&#8221;
or &#8220;oxygen&#8221; process, and, although of undoubted service in
comparing the quality of samples of very impure water, it is defective
in the following important respects: Different organic substances are
not affected to an equal extent by potassium permanganate; albumen,
for instance, being far less easily oxidised than other compounds,
and the value of the results afforded is vitiated by the presence of
certain inorganic bodies, such as nitrites, sulphuretted hydrogen,
ferrous salts, etc. It has been stated, that the more deleterious
and putrescent organic ingredients of water are those most readily
affected by the permanganate solution. As modified and improved
by Miller<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a
href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and by
Tidy,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a
href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> the process
consists substantially <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>in adding an excess of a standard
solution of potassium permanganate to a measured quantity of the
water under examination (acidulated with sulphuric acid), and then
determining the excess of permanganate used by means of sodium
hyposulphite and potassium iodide. The following solutions are
required:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Potassium Permanganate.</i>&mdash;0&middot;395 gramme of the salt is
dissolved in 1 litre of distilled water; 10 c.c. of this solution
represent 0&middot;001 gramme of available oxygen.</p>

<p><i>Sodium Hyposulphite.</i>&mdash;One gramme of the salt is dissolved in
a litre of water.</p>

<p><i>Starch solution.</i>&mdash;One gramme of starch is triturated with
about 20 c.c. of boiling water, and the mixture allowed to stand at
rest over night, after which the clear supernatant solution is drawn
off.</p>

<p><i>Pure distilled Water.</i>&mdash;This is prepared by digesting 10
litres of distilled water with 10 grammes of potassium hydroxide
and 2 grammes of potassium permanganate in a still provided with an
inverted condenser at 100&#176; for twenty-four hours, after which the
water is distilled, separate portions being frequently tested with
Nessler&#8217;s solution; the distillate is not reserved for use until
this reagent ceases to produce a brownish coloration.</p>

<p>The determination proper is executed as follows:&mdash;Two flasks
are first thoroughly cleansed by washing with concentrated sulphuric
acid, and subsequently with water; 250 c.c. of the water to be examined
are introduced into one, and the same volume of the pure distilled
water, prepared as above, is placed in the other. 10 c.c. of dilute
sulphuric acid (1 part pure acid and 8 parts distilled water) and 10
c.c. of the potassium permanganate solution are now added to each
flask, both then being put aside for three hours. Two drops of a 10 per
cent. solution of potassium iodide are next added to the flasks, and
the amount of iodine liberated (which is equivalent to the quantity
of permanganate unacted upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205"
id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> by the water) is determined by titration
with the sodium hyposulphite solution. The precise end of the reaction
is ascertained by means of a few drops of the starch paste, the
hyposulphite being added to each flask until the blue colour produced
by the starch disappears. The quantities of solution used in each
titration are then read off.</p>

<p>The amount of permanganate consumed is equal to A-B, where A
represents the hyposulphite used with the distilled water, and B,
that used with the sample under examination, and the proportion of
oxygen which is consumed by the water tested, can be calculated by the
formula:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">(A - B) <i>a</i></span>
  <span class="denominator">A</span>
</span></p>

<p>in which <i>a</i> is the available oxygen in the added permanganate.
For example, if 10 c.c. of permanganate (= 0&middot;001 gramme available
oxygen) are added to the 250 c.c. (= &frac14; litre) contained in each
flask, and the distilled water required 35 c.c., the sample 15 c.c.,
of the hyposulphite solution, the proportion of oxygen consumed by the
&frac14; litre of water, would be</p>

<p class="center"><span class="division">
  <span class="numerator">(35 - 15) &times; &middot;001</span>
  <span class="denominator">35</span>
</span></p>

<p>= &middot;000571, which represents &middot;228 parts of oxygen in 100,000 parts of
water.</p>

<p>In applying the preceding test, it is requisite that the flasks
should be kept at a particular temperature, such as 27&#176;. The presence
of putrescent and readily oxidised organic matter or nitrites, which
indicates dangerous contamination, is recognised by the absorption of
any considerable proportion of oxygen in the space of two minutes.
According to Dr. Tidy, 100,000 parts of water of various degrees of
purity, absorb the following amount of oxygen in three hours:&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <i>Chlorine.</i>&mdash;The importance attached to the estimation
of chlorine in potable waters is derived from the fact that this
element enters largely into the food of men and animals, and is thrown
off in their excreta. This, naturally, contributes to the sewage
contamination to which water is often exposed. Water, however, may
take up a certain proportion of chlorides from the geological strata
through which it passes, and it is of importance to bear this fact in
mind in forming a conclusion as to the significance of the results
afforded by this determination. It is, likewise, to be remembered that
vegetable organic pollution would escape detection were the quantity of
chlorine contained alone taken into consideration. The determination is
conveniently made as follows:&mdash;50 c.c. of the water are introduced
into a beaker, a drop or two of a concentrated and neutral solution
of potassium chromate added, and then a standard solution of silver
nitrate very cautiously added from a burette, drop by drop, until a
faint but permanent red tint is produced. If the silver solution is
prepared by dissolving 2&middot;394 grammes of the nitrate in 1 litre of
distilled water, the number of c.c. required to cause the reddish
coloration directly indicates the parts of chlorine present in 100,000
parts of the water examined. According to Frankland, 100,000 parts
of water from various sources contain the following proportions of
chlorine:&mdash;</p>

<p>The amount of chlorine contained in sewage is stated
to range from 6&middot;5 to 21&middot;5 parts, the average being 11&middot;54
parts.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a
href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It is generally
considered that a proportion in excess of 5 parts in 100,000 parts
of a drinking water, which is not liable to be affected by mineral
admixture, is to be ascribed to organic contamination.</p>

<p>5. <i>Ammonia, free and albuminoid.</i>&mdash;It has already been
mentioned that the decomposition of the nitrogenous organic impurities
present in polluted water results in the production, first, of
ammonia, then of nitrites and nitrates, and, as it is commonly
asserted that the deleterious character of water is mainly due to
the putrefactive processes taking place, which are probably directly
proportionate to the quantity of ammonia produced, it is evident that
the determination of this compound is of considerable importance.
The proportion of albuminous and allied constituents in a sample
can, moreover, be measured by the quantity of ammonia produced
when the water is boiled with an alkaline solution of potassium
permanganate. Upon the foregoing facts, Messrs. Wanklyn, Chapman,
and Smith<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a
href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> have based a method
for the determination of the sanitary quality of potable waters,
which is in very general use. It involves, first, an estimation of
the ammonia generated upon distilling the water with sodium carbonate
(&#8220;free&#8221; ammonia); second, the quantity given off by
boiling with alkaline potassium permanganate (&#8220;albuminoid&#8221;
ammonia). In case the water tested is contaminated with urea, which
is not improbable, this compound will be decomposed into ammonia by
the treatment with sodium <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208"
id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>carbonate. The following solutions are
employed in the execution of the test:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ammonium Chloride.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 1&middot;5735 grammes of the dry and
pure salt in 1 litre of distilled water. When required for use, dilute
100 c.c. of the solution to 1 litre; 1 c.c. of this diluted solution
contains &middot;00005 gramme of NH<span class="sub">3</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pure Sodium Carbonate.</i>&mdash;The ordinary pure reagent is freed
from any ammonia possibly contained by heating it in a platinum
capsule.</p>

<p><i>Pure distilled Water.</i>&mdash;This is obtained as directed on p.
204.</p>

<p><i>Nessler&#8217;s Reagent.</i>&mdash;This is a strong alkaline solution
of mercury biniodide. It may be prepared by first dissolving 62&middot;5
grammes of potassium iodide in 250 c.c. of hot distilled water
(reserving 10 c.c. of the solution), and adding a concentrated solution
of mercury bichloride, with constant shaking, to the remainder, until
a permanent precipitate remains undissolved; this is then brought in
solution by means of the 10 c.c. of iodide solution, set aside, and the
addition of mercury bichloride is carefully continued until a slight
precipitate reappears. A concentrated solution of potassium hydroxide
(200 grammes dissolved in water) is now added, and the volume of the
whole made up with distilled water to 1 litre. The solution is then
allowed to subside, after which it is decanted and preserved in a
well-stoppered bottle.</p>

<p><i>Permanganate solution.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 8 grammes of potassium
permanganate and 200 grammes of potassium hydroxide in 1 litre of
water, and boil to expel any ammonia present.</p>

<p>The estimation of free and albuminoid ammonia is made as
follows:&mdash;100 c.c. of the water to be examined are introduced
into a glass retort, which connects with a Liebig&#8217;s condenser,
and has previously been thoroughly cleansed by boiling with distilled
water; one gramme of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"
id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> sodium carbonate is added, and the
water distilled until 40 c.c. have passed over, the distillate being
separately collected in four 10 c.c. cylinders or tubes. About 10 c.c.
of the alkaline solution of potassium permanganate is then added to
the remaining contents of the retort, and the distillation continued
almost to dryness. The second distillate is likewise collected in
fractions of 10 c.c. each. It is advisable to so regulate the process
of distillation, that only about 10 c.c. pass over in the space of
eight minutes. The two sets of distillates are then separately tested
by adding 0&middot;5 c.c. of the Nessler solution to each cylinder, well
stirring the mixture, and setting it aside for at least five minutes. A
series of comparison tubes (10 c.c. in capacity) are prepared by adding
&middot;001, &middot;003, &middot;005 up to &middot;01 gramme of ammonium chloride, and filling to
the 10 c.c. mark with pure distilled water; 0&middot;5 c.c. of the Nessler
reagent being added to each. The degree of coloration exhibited in the
cylinders containing the two sets of distillates is then matched by the
comparison cylinders.</p>

<p>It is evident, that from the data thus obtained, the amount of
ammonia obtained by the first distillation with sodium carbonate (free
ammonia), and by the second distillation with alkaline potassium
permanganate (albuminoid ammonia), can be determined. It has been
previously mentioned that urea evolves ammonia when boiled with sodium
carbonate; the amount of ammonia obtained by the first process of
distillation will therefore include that actually contained as such
in the water, and that generated by the decomposition of any urea
possibly present. As the presence of this body is incompatible with a
good drinking water, this fact is of little real importance. In case,
however, it be desired to make an estimation of the free ammonia really
present, 500 c.c. of the water to be tested are treated with 1 or 2
c.c. of calcium chloride solution, then with a slight excess of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
potassium hydroxide, and the liquid filtered. It is next distilled as
directed above, and the remaining contents of the retort made up to 500
c.c. 200 c.c. of the original sample are then subjected to the same
treatment with calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide, and filtered.
The second solution, which contains all the ammonia originally present
in the water, is now tested with Nessler&#8217;s reagent, the solution
first obtained by diluting the contents of the retort being employed,
instead of pure distilled water, for comparison.</p>

<p>The proportions of free and albuminoid ammonia found in the
preceding operations are usually expressed in parts per 100,000 of
the water. Wanklyn gives the following amounts of free and albuminoid
ammonia contained in 100,000 parts of several kinds of water:&mdash;</p>

<p>The same authority makes the following classification of
potable water, reference being made to parts of albuminoid
ammonia present in 100,000 parts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center tbl">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Extraordinary purity</td><td class="tdr">0 to 0&middot;005</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Dirty</td><td class="tdr">over 0&middot;010</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The presence of any considerable proportion of free ammonia is
usually indicative of recent sewage contamination. In the absence
of free ammonia, a water need not be rejected unless the albuminoid
ammonia exceeds 0&middot;010 part, but a water containing over 0&middot;015 part of
albuminoid ammonia should be condemned under all circumstances.</p>

<p>6. <i>Nitrogen as nitrites and nitrates.</i>&mdash;It is quite
generally accepted that the presence in water of the oxidation<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
products of nitrogen, is to be ascribed to the oxidation of nitrogenous
organic matter, unless they are the result of percolation through soil
containing nitrates, and, for this reason, considerable importance
attaches to the quantitative estimation of the nitrogen present in
the state of nitrates, and, in some cases, nitrites. One of the most
reliable methods for this determination is the eudiometric process of
Frankland, which is based upon that of Crum,<a name="FNanchor_125_125"
id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125"
class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and consists in agitating the concentrated
water with mercury and strong sulphuric acid, and measuring the volume
of nitric oxide formed by the reduction of nitrates and nitrites.
Owing, however, to the necessity of employing gas apparatus, this
method is not in very general use. Wanklyn&#8217;s process is the
following:&mdash;100 c.c. of the sample are made alkaline with pure
sodium hydroxide, evaporated to about one-fourth of its original
volume, next made up to 100 c.c. by adding pure distilled water, and
introduced into a flask which connects with a U-tube filled with
powdered glass moistened with hydrochloric acid. A piece of aluminium
foil is then added to the contents of the flask, and the mixture is
allowed to stand at rest for six or seven hours. The contents of the
U-tube are now transferred to the flask, the latter is connected with
a Liebig&#8217;s condenser and the liquid distilled. The proportion of
ammonia contained in the distillate is determined by Nessler&#8217;s
reagent as previously described, from which the amount of nitrogen
present as nitrates and nitrites is calculated.</p>

<p>Griess<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a
href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> has suggested
a very useful process for the determination of nitrous acid and
nitrites in potable waters. It is executed by placing 100 c.c.
of the filtered water in a glass cylinder, and adding a few
drops of dilute hydrochloric acid, and 1 c.c. of a solution of
sulphanilic acid and naphthylamine hydrochloride. In the presence
of nitrites, a beautiful rose-red colour (due to the formation of
azobenzol-naphthylamine <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>sulphonic acid), will be produced. The
proportion of nitrites contained in the water, is ascertained by
simultaneously subjecting a solution of potassium nitrite, of known
strength, to the same treatment, and matching the degree of colour
obtained, as in the Nessler process. This solution can be prepared by
dissolving 0&middot;406 gramme of dry silver nitrite in hot water, and adding
a slight excess of potassium chloride. After cooling, the solution is
made up to one litre, the silver chloride allowed to settle, and the
clear liquid filtered. If 100 c.c. of the filtrate are further diluted
to one litre, each c.c. will contain 0&middot;00001 gramme of nitrous acid.</p>

<p>In Ditmar&#8217;s method, the residue obtained by the evaporation
of the water, is first mixed with pure sodium hydroxide, and placed
in a small silver boat. It is next introduced into a combustion tube
and burned in a current of hydrogen, the evolved gases being received
in an absorption apparatus filled with very dilute hydrochloric acid.
In this method the amount of ammonia formed, is likewise estimated by
means of Nessler&#8217;s solution. The proportion of <em>organic nitrogen</em>
is found by deducting the free ammonia present in the water and
multiplying the remainder by <span class="sup">14</span>&frasl;<span
class="sub">17</span>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Dupr&eacute; and Hake<a name="FNanchor_127_127"
id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a> determine the <em>organic carbon</em> in water
essentially as follows:&mdash;The residue of the evaporation of the
water is obtained in a very thin silver dish, which can be rolled up
and introduced into a combustion tube filled three-fourths of its
length with cupric oxide. The residue is then burned in a stream of
oxygen. The evolved carbonic acid is absorbed in a solution of barium
hydroxide, the precipitate formed being collected upon a filter,
washed, dried, and weighed; its weight, divided by 19&middot;4, gives the
amount of organic carbon present in the sample. The carbonates
and nitrates originally contained in the water can be removed by
boiling with a saturated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213"
id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>solution of sulphurous acid before the
preliminary evaporation.</p>

<p>Frankland gives the following average proportions of nitrogen,
as nitrates, occurring in 100,000 parts of various kinds of
water:&mdash;</p>

<p>Professor J. W. Mallet<a name="FNanchor_129_129"
id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a> suggests the idea, that the noxious
character of potable waters containing nitrates and nitrites, with but
small proportions of organic matter, may be due to the presence of a
special nitrifying ferment belonging to the lower organisms, which are
capable of propagating disease.</p>

<p>In regard to the degree of importance that should attach to definite
and arbitrary standards of purity, it appears to be accepted that,

of value in discriminating <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>between pure and impure waters, but
little reliance should be placed upon such criteria alone.</p>

<p>Professor Mallet, who has devoted much attention to the
investigation of potable waters, and whose opinion on this subject
is entitled to the highest consideration, arrived at the following
conclusions concerning the more vital points at issue in the
determination of the hygienic character of water:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1. It is not possible to decide absolutely upon the
wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of a drinking water by the mere use of
any of the processes examined for the estimation of organic matter or
its constituents.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. I would even go further, and say that in judging the
sanitary character of the water, not only must such processes be used
in conjunction with the investigation of other evidence of a more
general sort, as to the source and history of the water, but should
even be deemed of secondary importance in weighing the reasons for
accepting or rejecting a water not manifestly unfit for drinking on
other grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. There are no sound grounds on which to establish such
general &#8216;standards of purity&#8217; as have been proposed,
looking to exact amounts of &#8216;organic carbon&#8217; or
&#8216;nitrogen,&#8217; &#8216;albuminoid-ammonia,&#8217; &#8216;oxygen
of permanganate consumed,&#8217; etc., as permissible or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. Two entirely legitimate directions seem to be open for the
useful examination by chemical means of the organic constituents of
drinking water, namely; first, the detection of <em>very gross</em> pollution,
* * * * and, secondly, the periodical examination of a water supply,
as of a great city, in order that the normal or usual character of the
water having been previously ascertained, any suspicious changes, which
from time to time may occur, shall be promptly detected and their cause
investigated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The microscopic and biological investigations of water are
useful adjuncts to the chemical examination. The former<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> is
made by allowing a litre or more of the sample to remain at rest for
several hours, collecting the deposit formed and inspecting it by
means of the microscope, using low magnifying power at first. It will
be found advantageous to stain portions of the sediment obtained with
aniline violet, which, by a sort of predilection, attaches itself to
particular forms of vegetable and animal life, thereby rendering them
more distinct. The matters most usually observed in the microscopic
examination of the deposit are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Numerous lifeless substances, such as mineral matters,
vegetable <em>debris</em>, muscular and cellular tissues, hairs, hemp, wool,
cotton, silk, starch cells, insect remains, and pollen grains.</p>

<p>2nd. Living vegetable forms, such as conferv&aelig;, various
alg&aelig;, oscillatoria, desmids, diatoms, and bacteria.</p>

<p>3rd. Living animal forms, including many varieties of infusoria and
animalcula. Of the latter, those known as &#8220;saprophytes&#8221;
are regarded as specially indicating the presence of sewage
contamination.</p>

<p>Certain varieties of bacteria have been found associated with
some forms of disease, and particular attention has been bestowed
upon the study of these germs. The biological examination of water
consists of pathological experiments on living animals, made by
injecting a solution of the water-residue beneath the skins of rabbits,
etc., and of experiments made by inoculating culture gelatine with
the water. Of the latter methods of examination, that originally
suggested by Dr. Koch, of Berlin, and described by Dr. Percy F.
Frankland,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a
href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> is well worthy of
mention. In this process, the lower forms of life are cultivated in a
solid medium, by means of which the growth of each colony is localised
and rendered suitable for microscopic inspection.</p>

<p>The medium employed by Dr. Frankland has the following
composition:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<div class="center tbl">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Lean meat</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td class="tdl">lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Gelatine</td><td class="tdr">150</td><td class="tdl">grammes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Solid peptone</td><td class="tdr">10</td><td class="tdc">&#8222;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Distilled water</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td class="tdl">litre.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The finely-cut meat is first infused in half a litre of cold water
for two hours and strained; the gelatine is digested in the other
half-litre of water, then mixed with the meat-extract, and the whole
heated until the gelatine is completely dissolved, when the peptone and
salt are added.</p>

<p>The liquid is now cautiously neutralised with sodium carbonate,
and clarified by beating it together with two or three eggs, boiling,
straining through cloth, and filtering hot through bibulous paper;
upon cooling it sets to a transparent jelly. Before setting, 7 c.c. of
the liquid are introduced into a series of clean test-tubes, which are
tightly plugged with cotton-wool and then sterilised by steaming them
half-an-hour for three or four consecutive days. It is necessary to
observe special precautions in the collection of the sample of water to
be examined. Glass-stoppered bottles are well adapted for this purpose.
These are to be very thoroughly washed with distilled water, then dried
and finally sterilised by heating in an air-bath for three or four
hours at a temperature of from 150&#176; to 180&#176;.</p>

<p>The actual examination of the water is executed by first heating
one of the test-tubes containing the sterilised gelatin medium in a
water-bath to 30&#176;, by which it is fused. The external portion of the
cotton-wool is next burned, the tube opened, and a certain number of
drops of the water to be tested (previously well shaken) are introduced
by means of a sterilised pipette. The mixture is immediately poured
out upon a clean and sterilised glass plate which rests in a perfectly
horizontal position, and is covered by a glass shade. The plate is
supported by a glass tripod which dips into a dish containing a two per
cent. solution of mercuric chloride&mdash;thus forming an antiseptic
protection from the external air. The tripods,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> dishes, etc., are
sterilised by washing them with the mercuric chloride solution. As
soon as the gelatine mixture has set, the glass plate (together with
the cover) is introduced into an air-bath kept at a temperature of
from 20&#176;-25&#176;, where it is allowed to remain for two to five days for
incubation. The individual organisms and the progress of the formation
of colonies are observed from time to time by inspecting the plate,
which can be done without removing the glass cover. As soon as they
have become easily visible to the naked eye, the plate is removed
from the bath, and placed upon another glass plate, which is ruled in
squares, and put over a black paper. The colonies are then counted
by aid of a lens, or, if they are too numerous to admit of this, the
number contained in a few of the squares is determined and multiplied
accordingly.</p>

<p>Dr. Frankland has applied the foregoing method to the examination of
the London water supply (1885), with the following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>The original drawings from which Plate XI. is taken were prepared by
Mr. William B. Lewis, for the Metropolitan Board of Health.</p>

<p>The presence of these organisms, however startling some of them may
be in appearance, is usually not objectionable; indeed, microscopic
vegetable growths are frequently of service in the purification of
potable water. The more important forms of bacteria (bacilli, etc.),
present minute rod-like shapes, far less impressive in appearance.</p>

<p>Considerable difference of opinion exists in regard to the
sanitary value of the results afforded by the biological examination
of water. While the number of bacteria found in a given quantity of
water may be of aid in the formation of an opinion as to its relative
safety for domestic purposes, it should be borne in mind that these
micro-organisms are almost omnipresent, being contained in the air, and
in soils, and articles of food.</p>

<p>The rather common belief that freezing purifies water is incorrect.
It is said, that the greater part of the ice supply of New York
City (three millions of tons) is gathered from the Hudson River
between Albany and Poughkeepsie, most being drawn within thirty
miles of the former city, and therefore liable to be polluted with
sewage. The average number of bacteria in one c.c. of ordinary ice
is stated to approximate 400, but Hudson River ice has been found
to contain nearly 2000 bacteria per c.c.<a name="FNanchor_132_132"

is usually about 9000; Hudson River snow-ice contains 20,000 per c.c.;
and, although the great majority of these organisms are perfectly
harmless, cases are on record where epidemics (as of gastro-enteritis)
have been directly traced to the use of impure ice.</p>

<h2>VINEGAR.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Vinegar</span> is a dilute aqueous solution
of acetic acid, containing inconsiderable proportions of alcohol,
aldehyde, acetic ether, and extractive matters, which, to some extent,
impart a characteristic flavour and aroma. The process most frequently
involved in the preparation of vinegar is known as the acetous
fermentation, and may be induced in various saccharine juices and
infusions, such as those of apples, wine, malted grain, etc., when,
in presence of a ferment, they are exposed to the action of the air,
at a temperature between 24&#176; and 32&#176;. In the oxidation of alcohol, an
intermediate compound (aldehyde) is at first formed, which, by the
continued action of oxygen, is ultimately converted into acetic acid.
A dilute solution of alcohol is, however, not oxidised to acetic acid
by simple exposure to the air; it is usually necessary that a peculiar
microscopic plant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mycoderma aceti</i>) should be present. This fungus
includes two varieties, viz., minute globules (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">micrococci</i>) and
rod-like forms (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bacilli</i>) varying in size; and is often developed
in old casks that have been long employed for making vinegar. It
constitutes a gelatinous mass (&#8220;mother of vinegar&#8221;) having
the appearance of glue that has been soaked in cold water; the surface
quickly becomes coated with a bluish mould (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Penicillium glaucum</i>).</p>

<p>Pasteur regards acetification as a product of the development of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mycoderma aceti</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, as a physiological fermentation&mdash;but
it appears probable that the process is rather one of oxidation,
and that the fungus accelerates the change by condensing the oxygen
upon its surface and delivering it to the alcohol, possibly in the
form of ozone. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> the process of vinegar making may
take place in the entire absence of the <em>mycoderma</em>, as when spongy
platinum is brought into contact with alcoholic solutions; and Buchner
has examined shavings which had been used in a vinegar factory for
over twenty-five years, and found them to be absolutely free from the
fungoid plant. In the United States, the best known and most esteemed
kind of vinegar is that obtained by the acetification of apple cider;
but by far the largest quantity is manufactured from alcohol and
spirituous liquors. Cider vinegar is free from aldehyde but contains
malic acid. The usual source of vinegar in Great Britain is a wort
prepared from mixtures of malt with other grain; while, in Continental
Europe, inferior sorts of new wine (especially white wine) are
extensively employed for its production.</p>

<p>Malt vinegar possesses a brown colour and a density ranging from
1&middot;006 to 1&middot;019; that known as proof vinegar contains from 4&middot;6 to 5 per
cent. of acetic acid. In Great Britain the manufacturer is allowed
by law to add 0&middot;1 per cent. of sulphuric acid to vinegar, on account
of its supposed preservative action, and, although the practice is
now known to be unnecessary, it is still sometimes resorted to. The
specific gravity of wine vinegar varies from 1&middot;014 to 1&middot;022. 100 c.c.
should neutralise from 0&middot;6 to 0&middot;7 grains of sodium carbonate, and the
solids obtained upon evaporation to dryness should approximate two per
cent. According to the United States Pharmacop&#339;ia, one fluid ounce
of vinegar should require for saturation not less than 35 grains of
potassium bicarbonate.</p>

<p>In 500 samples of imported wine and malt vinegar tested by the
author, the minimum and maximum strength ranged from 3 to 10&middot;6 per
cent. of acetic acid, the specific gravity from 1&middot;0074 to 1&middot;0150, and
the number of grains of potassium bicarbonate required to neutralise
one troy ounce from 22 to 84. Of 273 samples of vinegar tested in
1884 by the Massachusetts State Board of Health, 52 were above<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> the
then legal standard of 5 per cent. of acetic acid, and 221 below; 109
of the latter contained more than 4 per cent.; the strongest sample
showed 8&middot;86 per cent., and the weakest contained but 0&middot;66 per cent.
of acetic acid. In the year 1885, 114 samples were examined, of which
45 were above and 69 below the standard of 4&frac12; per cent. acetic
acid.</p>

<p>In the State of New York, the legal standard for vinegar is 4&middot;5 of
absolute acetic acid, and, in the case of cider vinegar, the proportion
of total solids must not fall below 2 per cent. In Massachusetts, also,
the acidity must be equivalent to 4&frac12; per cent. of acetic acid,
and cider vinegar must contain, at least, 2 per cent. of solid matter.
The English standard of strength is 3 per cent. of acetic acid.</p>

<p><i>Analysis.</i>&mdash;For the requirements of the United States Customs
Service, the only estimations ordinarily made are the specific gravity,
and a determination of the acidity. The former is accomplished by means
of the specific gravity bottle; the latter, by placing 10 c.c. of the
sample in a beaker, adding about 30 c.c. of water, then a few drops of
an alcoholic solution of phenol-phthale&iuml;n (to serve as the indicator),
and titrating with a normal alkali-solution; the number of c.c. used
divided by 10 and multiplied by 48, gives the amount, in grains, of
potassium bicarbonate required to neutralise one troy ounce of the
vinegar. In the presence of sulphuric acid, it is necessary to distil
a measured quantity of the sample almost to dryness and titrate the
distillate, it being assumed that 80 per cent. of the total acetic acid
present passes over.</p>

<p>The determination of the extract or solid residue in vinegar is
executed in the same manner as described under beer and wine. Several
tests have been suggested for the detection of the presence of free
sulphuric acid. The usual reagent&mdash;barium chloride&mdash;is not
well adapted to the direct determination of this acid, since sulphates,
which are as readily precipitated as the free acid, may also be
present. The following methods may be employed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228"
id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>1. A piece of cane sugar is moistened with a small quantity of the
sample and exposed to the heat of the water-bath for some time, when,
in presence of free sulphuric acid, the residue will become more or
less carbonised, according to the proportion of acid present.</p>

<p>2. Five centigrammes of pulverised starch are dissolved in a
decilitre of the sample by boiling, and after the liquid has become
completely cooled, a few drops of iodine solution are added. Dilute
acetic acid does not affect starch, and if the sample is pure, a blue
coloration will be produced; if, however, but a minute quantity of
sulphuric or other mineral acid is present, the starch is converted
into dextrine, and the addition of iodine fails to cause the blue
coloration.</p>

<p>3. According to Hilger,<a name="FNanchor_133_133"
id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133"
class="fnanchor">[133]</a> if two drops of a very dilute solution of
methyl aniline violet (0&middot;1 to 100) are added to about 25 c.c. of pure
vinegar no change of colour takes place; whereas, in the presence of
0&middot;2 per cent. of mineral acid, a bluish coloration is produced; in
case the proportion of acid reaches 1 per cent. the liquid acquires a
greenish tint.</p>

<p>4. A recent test for mineral acids has been suggested by
Hager.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a
href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It consists in
warming together two drops of East Indian copaiba balsam, and 30 drops
of pure acetic acid, and subsequently adding to the mixture two or
three drops of the vinegar under examination; if either sulphuric or
hydrochloric acid be present, a blue-violet colour is produced.</p>

<p>The free mineral acids in vinegar may be quantitatively estimated by
saturating a weighed quantity of the sample with quinine, evaporating
the mixture to dryness over the water-bath, and dissolving the quinine
salts formed in alcohol, which is then removed by distillation. The
second residue is next dissolved in water, and the quinine precipitated
by addition of ammonia, and separated by filtration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229"
id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The filtrate will contain the mineral acids present, and their
amount is determined by the ordinary methods.</p>

<p>The free sulphuric acid in vinegar can also be quantitatively
estimated, according to Kohnstein,<a name="FNanchor_135_135"
id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> as follows: 100 c.c. of the sample are
shaken with pure and freshly calcined magnesia until completely
neutralised. The mixture is filtered, the filtrate evaporated to
dryness in a platinum dish and the residue ignited at a moderate
temperature. By this treatment magnesium acetate is converted into the
corresponding carbonate, while any magnesium sulphate present will
remain unaltered. The ignited residue is moistened and evaporated with
a little carbonic acid water, then digested with hot water, and the
solution filtered; the insoluble magnesium carbonate remains upon the
filter, the sulphate going in solution; the precipitate is thoroughly
washed. After removing the traces of lime possibly present, the amount
of magnesia contained in the filtrate is determined as pyrophosphate,
from the weight of which the proportion of free sulphuric acid
originally contained is calculated. The presence of metallic impurities
in vinegar is detected by means of the usual reagents, such as
hydrosulphuric acid and ammonium sulphide. In addition to water and
sulphuric acid, the most common adulterants of vinegar are capsicum,
sulphurous acid and various colouring matters. The presence of capsicum
and other acrid substances is usually revealed by the pungent odour
produced upon burning the solid residue obtained by the evaporation
of the sample to dryness, and by the peculiar taste of the residue.
Sulphurous acid is sometimes detected by its characteristic odour; its
determination is described on p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a>.</p>

<p>Caramel is recognised by extracting the solid residue with alcohol,
and evaporating the solution to dryness; in its presence, the residue
now obtained will possess a decidedly dark colour, and a bitter
taste. Fuchsine, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230"
id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>is said to have been employed for
colouring vinegar, is detected by the tests mentioned under Wine.</p>

<p>As already stated, a very large proportion of vinegar is made in
the United States from spirituous liquors. It is probable that fully
90 per cent. of the total production is obtained by the acetification
of whisky. Much of this product is mixed with cider vinegar, or simply
coloured with caramel, and then put on the market as apple vinegar. It
is certain that the manufacturers of whisky vinegar, who are permitted
by law to make &#8220;low wines&#8221; on their premises, without
being subjected to the usual Internal Revenue Tax, are frequently
enabled to perpetrate a fraud on the Government by disposing of the
spirits so produced to the whisky trade, instead of converting it
wholly into vinegar. To so great an extent is this practice carried
on, that many of the cider vinegar producers have found it impossible
to successfully compete with the less scrupulous manufacturers. Whisky
vinegar is nearly colourless, usually possesses a greater strength than
cider vinegar, and is free from malic acid. Cider vinegar exhibits
a light-brownish colour and a characteristic odour. Some of the
differences between these two varieties are shown by the following
results, obtained by the author by the examination of samples of pure
apple and whisky vinegar, fresh from the factories:&mdash;</p>

<p>Naturally the addition of caramel or cider vinegar to whisky vinegar
would greatly affect the above tests.</p>

<p>Attempts made to differentiate between the two samples by means of
qualitative reactions for aldehyde and malic acid were not sufficiently
distinctive in their results to be of much value.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the presence of <em>nitrates</em> in vinegar
would point to its origin from spirits. The apple vinegar manufacturer,
however, frequently finds his product above the standard, in which case
he reduces its strength by adding water, thus rendering this test of
little or no avail.</p>

<p>Regarding the addition of mineral acids to vinegar in the United
States, it is satisfactory to note that, of a large number of samples
tested by the New York City Vinegar Inspector during the past year, not
a single sample was found to contain these adulterants.</p>

<p>Fermented infusions of molasses, &#8220;black strap,&#8221; etc.,
are occasionally employed in the manufacture of vinegar. The product
obtained from these sources has been found in some instances to contain
acrid and probably noxious ingredients.</p>

<h2>PICKLES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> examination of pickles naturally
includes a determination of the character of the vinegar used in their
preparation. This is made by the methods just described. The practice
of imparting a bright green colour to pickles which have become
bleached by long preservation in brine or by other means, is doubtless
still prevalent, and calls for a brief notice. The greening of pickles
is effected either by the direct addition of cupric sulphate to the
water in which they are heated, or by introducing some form of metallic
copper into the bath. Alum is stated to be also occasionally employed
for the same purpose. The presence of copper is readily detected by
incinerating a rather considerable quantity of the pickles, treating
the ash with a little nitric acid and adding an excess of ammonium
hydroxide to the solution, when, in presence of the metal, a blue
coloration will be produced. The quantitative estimation of copper
is made by boiling the residue, obtained by the evaporation of the
vinegar or the incineration of the pickles, with dilute nitric acid,
adding a small quantity of sulphuric acid and expelling the excess of
nitric acid by evaporating nearly to dryness. The solution is next
diluted with water, filtered, and the filtrate placed in a platinum
capsule. The copper is then deposited by electrolysis. In the Report
of the Brooklyn Board of Health for the year 1885, a case is recorded
where a child ate a portion of a pickle coloured with cupric sulphate
(containing an estimated quantity of 2&frac12; grains of the salt),
with fatal results.</p>

<h2>OLIVE OIL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Olive Oil</span> is extracted from the pericarp
of the fruit of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Olea Europea</i>. When pure, it exhibits a pale
yellow or greenish colour, has a specific gravity of 0&middot;9176, and
possesses a faint, pleasant odour and a bland and agreeable taste.
It is insoluble in water, very slightly in alcohol, but dissolves
in about 1&frac12; parts of ether. Olive oil boils at 315&#176;, and
begins to deposit white granules at 10&#176;; at 0&#176;, it solidifies to a
solid mass which, by pressure, may be separated into tripalmetine
and trioleine. Upon saponification, it is decomposed into oleic,
palmetic, and stearic acids and glycerine. The best-known varieties
of olive oil met with in commerce, in the order of their quality,
are&mdash;Provence, Florence, Lucca, Genoa, Gallipoli, Sicily, and
Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a
href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the high price of the pure article, and perhaps to
the difficulty experienced in detecting foreign admixtures, olive
oil is probably more extensively adulterated than any substance
of general consumption. The oils most employed as adulterants are
those of cotton-seed, poppy, pea-nut, sesam&eacute;, rape-seed, arachis,
and lard. Although the subject of the adulteration of olive oil has
received the attention of numerous chemists, including several of
exceptionally high standing, the results obtained, while of service in
indicating the presence of some foreign oil, are unfortunately often
of but little use in the positive identification of the particular
adulterant used. Of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>many methods of examination that have
been suggested, the following are the most satisfactory:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Specific gravity.</i>&mdash;The density of olive oil is lower
than that of the majority of the oils with which it is mixed, and
it is sometimes possible to detect the presence of the latter by
means of this property, especially when they are contained in a
considerable proportion. Cotton-seed oil differs more in specific
gravity than the other oils generally employed as adulterants.
Donny<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a
href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> applies the test
by placing in the suspected sample a drop of olive oil of known purity
which has been dyed with ground alkanet root, and observing whether
it remains stationary. A more satisfactory method is to determine the
density by the gravity bottle. The following tabulation gives the
densities (at 15&#176;) of olive and several other oils liable to be met
with as admixtures:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>Solidifying point.</i>&mdash;Attempts have been made to utilise
the fact that some of the oils added to olive congeal at a lower
temperature than the pure oil. Thus, cotton-seed oil solidifies at
-22&#176;, ground-nut oil at -33&#176;, poppy at -18&#176;.</p>

<p>3. <i>Elaidin and colour tests.</i>&mdash;Pure olive oil is converted
into a solid mass when treated with various oxidising agents, the
change being retarded by the presence of some of its adulterants. The
test may be made in several ways:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Ten grms. of the sample are shaken with 5 grms. of nitric
acid (sp. gr. 1&middot;40) and 1 grm. of mercury, and the colour produced and
time required for solidification noticed. In this manner the following
results have been obtained:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Or a few pieces of copper foil are added to a mixture of equal
parts of the oil and nitric acid, the liquor occasionally stirred, and
then set aside. If the oil be pure, it will be converted into a nearly
white buttery mass in from three to six hours; sesam&eacute; oil yields a
red, cotton and rape-seed a brown, and beech-nut a reddish-yellow
colour, the solidification being delayed from 10 to 20 hours, while
poppy oil fails to solidify at all.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Nine parts of the sample are oxidised by heating with one
part of concentrated nitric acid, the mixture being well stirred; pure
olive oil forms a hard, pale-yellow mass in the course of two hours;
seed oils (including cotton-seed) turn orange-red in colour and do not
become solid in the same time or manner.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A portion of the sample is well mixed with one-fourth of its
weight of chromic acid; if pure, the oil will be converted into an
opaque mass.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Introduce 2 c.c. of the sample into a narrow graduated glass
cylinder, add 0&middot;1 gramme potassium dichromate, next 2 c.c. of a mixture
of sulphuric and nitric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236"
id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> acids, shake well, and then add 1 c.c.
of ether; shake again and allow the mixture to stand at rest. Lively
effervescence and evolution of nitrous fumes soon take place, and the
oil rises to the surface, showing a characteristic coloration. Olive
oil exhibits a green colour, whereas in presence of 5 per cent. of
sesam&eacute;, arachis, cotton-seed, or poppy oil, the colours will vary from
greenish-yellow to yellow or yellowish red. The coloration is more
readily observed upon agitating the mixture with water and, setting it
aside for a short time.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Several portions of the oil are placed upon a porcelain slab
and separately treated with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid,
nitric acid, and a solution of potassium dichromate in sulphuric acid,
and notice taken of the colours produced, comparative tests being
simultaneously made with olive oil of undoubted purity.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The presence of sesam&eacute; oil is readily detected by the
formation of a deep green colour when the oil is agitated with a
mixture of equal parts of nitric and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Upon mixing samples containing cotton-seed oil with an equal
volume of nitric acid (40&#176; B.) a coffee-like colour is produced. Olive
oil gives a pale green, rape and nut, a pale rose, and sesam&eacute; oil a
white-coloured mixture.</p>

<p>The presence of rape- and cotton-seed oils may also be detected as
follows:&mdash;Dissolve 0&middot;1 gramme silver nitrate in a very little
water, and add about 4 c.c. of absolute alcohol. This solution is
added to the sample of olive oil to be tested, the mixture well
shaken and put aside for one or two hours; it is then to be heated
for a few minutes. If cotton-seed or rape-seed oil is present, the
oily stratum which separates on standing will exhibit a brownish-red
or blackish colour, due to the reduction of silver. Olive oil fails
to cause an appreciable coloration. Experiments made by the author
with samples of olive oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> containing 10 per cent. of cotton-seed
and rape-seed oils furnished the following results:&mdash;On standing
one hour, without heating, the mixture containing cotton-seed oil
showed a slightly dark colour, that adulterated with rape-seed oil
a decidedly dark colour; upon the application of heat, the former
exhibited a dark-red colour, while the latter turned quite black.</p>

<p><i>Maumen&eacute;&#8217;s test.</i>&mdash;This test is founded upon the
fact that the elevation of temperature caused by mixing olive oil
with strong sulphuric acid is considerably less than that produced
with the oils commonly employed as its adulterants. With these latter
an evolution of sulphurous acid generally takes place, which is not
the case with pure olive oil. The best method of procedure is as
follows:&mdash;10 c.c. of sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1&middot;844) are gradually
added to 50 grammes of the sample, the mixture being constantly
stirred with a small thermometer, and observations made of the maximum
increase of temperature produced, as well as of the evolution of gas.
When treated in this manner, genuine olive oil causes an elevation of
about 42&#176;; that given by various other oils, often added to it, ranges
from 52&#176; to 103&#176;, and it is frequently possible to recognise their
presence in admixtures by the high temperature produced. The following
are the increases of temperature observed by L. Archbutt:&mdash;olive,
41-45; rape, 55-64; arachis, 47-60; sesam&eacute;, 65; cotton-seed (crude)
70; (refined), 75-76; poppy-seed, 86-88; menhaden, 123-128. In the
Paris Municipal Laboratory an acid of 1&middot;834 sp. gr. is used, and the
following heating powers are regarded as standards:&mdash;For olive
oil, 55&middot;5&#176;; for cotton-seed, 69&middot;5&#176; for nut, 62&#176;; for sesam&eacute;,
66&#176;; for poppy oil, 73&#176;.</p>

<p>The application of Hubl&#8217;s test for butter (see p. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>) is one
of the most useful means for the detection of foreign oils in olive
oil. The iodine absorption number of the pure oil is considerably below
that of its most common adulterants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238"
id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The prevalence of the adulteration of olive oil has been abundantly
demonstrated. Of 232 samples examined by the New York and Massachusetts
State Boards of Health, 165 (71 per cent.) were spurious. It is a
notorious fact that large quantities of cotton-seed oil are exported
from the United States to France and Italy, much of which returns home
under the guise of the genuine product of the olive.</p>

<p>Eight samples were coloured with turmeric, 4 with Martius&#8217;
yellow, 12 contained starch, and 5 showed the presence of calcium
sulphate.</p>

<p>The article usually sold as mustard is a mixture of mustard farina,
prepared from different varieties of the seed, with wheaten flour
or starch, and turmeric. It is claimed by the manufacturers that
pure mustard possesses too acrid a taste to be suitable for use as
a condiment; and its admixture with the foregoing substances is so
generally resorted to and recognised, that the New York State Board of
Health, in 1883, legally sanctioned the practice, provided the fact
is distinctly stated upon the label of the packages. Other prevalent
forms of sophistication consist in the partial extraction of the fixed
oil from the mustard before its introduction on the market, and in the
addition of cocoa-nut shells, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra alba</i>, and &#8220;Martius&#8217;
yellow&#8221; (potassium dinitronaphthalate). The latter colouring
matter is specially objectionable, being poisonous in its action. The
presence of organic admixtures is usually recognised upon a microscopic
examination of the sample. The anatomical structure of mustard seed is
described by Fluckigen and Hamburg in &#8216;Pharmacographia.&#8217;
Wheaten flour or starch is readily identified by the iodine test. The
following methods are employed for the detection of turmeric:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A portion of the sample is agitated with castor oil and filtered.
In case turmeric is present, the filtrate will exhibit a marked
greenish fluorescence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241"
id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Upon treating the suspected sample with ammonium hydroxide, an
orange-red colour is produced in presence of turmeric. Or, the mustard
is boiled with methylic alcohol, the extract filtered, evaporated to
dryness, and the residue treated with hydrochloric acid; if turmeric
be present, an orange-red coloration takes place, which changes to a
bluish-green upon adding an excess of sodium hydroxide. In addition
to the above qualitative tests, valuable indications regarding the
purity of mustard are to be obtained by the determination of the
proportions of fixed oil, sulphur, and ash contained in the sample
under examination.</p>

<p><i>Fixed Oil.</i>&mdash;The amount of fixed oil is estimated by
digesting a weighed portion of the mustard with ether in a closed
vessel, filtering, and determining the weight of the residue left upon
evaporating the ethereal solution to dryness over the water-bath.
The oil possesses a specific gravity ranging from 0&middot;915 to 0&middot;920.
The percentage of fixed oil in pure mustard is very considerable
(usually over 34 per cent.), whereas the substances commonly added
contain but a very small quantity. In case wheaten flour has
been employed as an adulterant, the proportion of pure mustard
(<i>x</i>) in a mixed sample, can be approximately calculated by the
following formul&aelig;, in which <i>y</i> is the fixed amount of oil
contained.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a

</span> = <i>y</i>.
</p>

<p>In the absence of flour, a low percentage of fixed oil indicates the
presence of exhausted mustard cake.</p>

<p><i>Sulphur.</i>&mdash;Blyth determines the total sulphur by oxidation
with fuming nitric acid, diluting the liquid considerably with water,
filtering and precipitating the sulphates formed by means of barium
chloride. The proportion of sulphates <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>(in terms of barium
sulphate) found in the ash is to be deducted from the weight of the
precipitate obtained; the remainder, multiplied by 0&middot;1373, gives the
amount of sulphur present in organic combination, and, as the quantity
contained in this form in mustard is far greater than in any of the
substances employed for its adulteration, the estimation is frequently
very useful.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i>&mdash;The amount of ash is determined in the usual manner,
<i>i. e.</i> by the incineration of a weighed portion in a platinum capsule.
Genuine mustard contains about 5 per cent. of ash, of which nearly 1
per cent. is soluble in water. In presence of inorganic impurities, the
quantity of ash is naturally increased, while a proportion under 4 per
cent. is usually considered an indication of organic admixture.</p>

<p>The composition of the ash of mustard seed is given below:&mdash;</p>

<p>The adulteration of mustard is very extensively practised. Of 18
samples bought at random in the shops and tested for the New York State
Board of Health, 12 were found to be impure; of 88 samples, examined
in the year 1884 by the Massachusetts State Board, 20 were compounds
(labelled as such, but in a manner designed to deceive the purchaser).
37 were adulterated with flour, turmeric, and, in some cases, with
cayenne, and 31 were found to be pure; in 1885, 211 samples were
tested, of which 124 were sophisticated; of 27 samples tested by the
National Board of Health, 21 contained foreign admixtures, consisting
chiefly of wheat or flour and turmeric, but also including corn-starch,
rice, cayenne, and plaster of Paris.</p>

<h2>PEPPER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Pepper</span> is the dried unripe berry of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piper nigrum</i>; white pepper, which is much less in use, being the same
fruit deprived of its outer skin by maceration in water and friction.
The more important constituents of pepper are an alkaloid (piperin),
the volatile oil, and the resin, and upon these ingredients its value
as a condiment depends. The partial composition of genuine pepper, as
given by Blyth, is shown below:&mdash;</p>

<p>The same authority regards 50 per cent. of starch as the minimum
standard for unadulterated pepper. The granules of pepper-starch are
characterised by their exceedingly small size, being only about &middot;008
mm. in diameter.</p>

<p>The proportion of ash in genuine pepper seldom exceeds 7 per
cent., of which not over <span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span
class="sub">10</span>th should consist of sand; but in the commercial
article, the total ash often approximates 10 or 12 per cent., 40 or 50

<p>The list of adulterations used as admixtures to pepper, as well as
to most other ground condiments and spices, is quite extensive, and
includes such cheap and neutral substances <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>as ship-bread, corn,
ground cocoanut shells, beans, peas, hulls of mustard seed, sand, etc.,
etc. It is stated that in England large quantities of preparations
consisting of linseed-meal, mustard husks and rice-meal, known to the
trade respectively as P.D., H.P.D., and W.P.D., are very generally
employed in the adulteration of pepper. P.D. (pepper-dust), would
appear to also signify the sweepings collected from pepper factories,
and sometimes fortified with cayenne, the manufacture of which
article has given rise to a special industry. It is utilised as a
diluent of the various spices, the sophisticated products being sold
as &#8220;P.D. pepper,&#8221; &#8220;P.D. cloves,&#8221; &#8220;P.D.
cinnamon,&#8221; etc. Unfortunately the character of most of the
adulterants of pepper, as of other spices, is such, that little
assistance is afforded the analyst by chemical tests. A microscopic
examination of the suspected sample furnishes far more trustworthy
information and should in all instances be employed, comparative
observations being made with an article of known purity.</p>

<p>The appearance of several of the starch granules of various flours
often found in adulterated condiments and spices is represented in
Plate IX.</p>

<p>In the special case of pepper, it is of advantage to make chemical
determinations of the moisture, ash, piperin and resin.</p>

<p><i>Moisture.</i>&mdash;The proportion of moisture is estimated by the
ordinary method of drying a weighed portion of the pepper in a platinum
capsule at 100&#176;, and noting the loss in weight sustained.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i>&mdash;The dry sample is incinerated, and the amount of
mineral residue determined. As already intimated, the proportion of
sand present is of especial import.</p>

<p><i>Piperin and Resin.</i>&mdash;The pepper is repeatedly digested with
absolute alcohol, the mixture filtered and the filtrate evaporated to
dryness over a water-bath. The extract is weighed and then treated with
sodium hydroxide solution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246"
id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> in which the resin is soluble. The
alkaline liquid is then removed, and the remaining piperin dissolved in
alcohol, the solution filtered, evaporated to dryness, and the weight
of the residue determined. The proportion of piperin in unadulterated
pepper ranges from 4&middot;5 to 5&middot;5 per cent., that of resin from 1&middot;7 to 2
per cent.</p>

<p>Niederstadt,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a
href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> from the results of
his investigations, concludes, that genuine pepper should yield as much
as 7&middot;66 per cent. of piperin, and employs this factor for estimating
the purity of mixtures; thus, a sample adulterated with palm kernels
and husks, to the extent of about 80 per cent., contained but 1&middot;62 per
cent. of piperin.</p>

<p>Pepper contains a greater proportion of starch than
some of the substances employed in its adulteration. The
following method, suggested by Lenz,<a name="FNanchor_143_143"
id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a> may be used for the determination of this
constituent:&mdash;4 grammes of the sample are digested for several
hours in a flask with 250 c.c. of water, with occasional shaking,
and the decoction decanted upon a filter. The residue is washed and
returned to the flask, which is filled with water to a volume of 200
c.c., 20 c.c. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1&middot;121) are added, the flask
connected with an ascending Liebig&#8217;s condenser, and heated on
the water-bath for three hours. After cooling, the contents of the
flask are filtered into a half-litre flask, and the filtrate carefully
neutralised with sodium hydroxide and diluted up to the 500 c.c. mark.
It is finally tested by Fehling&#8217;s solution. The clarification of
the hot solution is assisted by the addition of a few drops of zinc
chloride. Lenz obtained by this process the following percentages of
sugar, calculated on the ash-free substances:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cayenne Pepper.</i>&mdash;Cayenne pepper is the ground berry and pods
of <i>Capsicum annuum</i>. Its well-known active properties, which were
formerly ascribed to an acrid oil termed <em>capsicin</em>, have lately been
shown to be due to the presence of the crystalline compound <em>capsaicin</em>
(C<span class="sub">9</span>H<span class="sub">14</span>O<span
class="sub">5</span>), fusing at 55&#176;, and capable of volatilisation
at 115&#176; without decomposition. The proportion of moisture in cayenne
pepper is about 12 per cent.; the alcoholic and ethereal extracts
should approximate, respectively, 25 and 9 per cent. The ash ranges
from 5&middot;5 to 6 per cent., of which nearly one-half should be soluble in
water. Strohmer<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a

<p>The organic adulterants sometimes met with in cayenne (flour,
mustard seed, husks, etc.), are detected by means of the microscope.
Among the mineral substances said to be employed as colouring agents,
such as iron ochre, brick-dust, red lead, and vermilion, the two
former are of more frequent occurrence, and may be recognised upon an
examination of the ash obtained by the incineration of the sample.</p>

<p>An adulterant of pepper, known in the trade as
&#8220;Poivrette&#8221; or &#8220;Pepperette,&#8221; has recently made
its appearance in England. It forms a cream-coloured powder, much
resembling the inner layer of the pepper-berry in bulk and cellular
structure, is exported from Italy, and evidently consists of ground
olive-stones, as is indicated by the following analyses, made by J.

<p>The extent to which the various forms of pepper are fraudulently
contaminated in the United States is illustrated by the fact that, out
of 386 samples of the condiment examined by the chemists of the New
York, Massachusetts and National State Boards of Health, 236 (or about
61 per cent.) were found to be adulterated.</p>

<h2>SPICES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> is the case with mustard and
pepper, the adulteration of the ordinary spices is exceedingly
prevalent in the United States. Probably those most subject to
admixture, are cloves, mace, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger. The
fact that these condiments are frequently offered for sale in a
ground state furnishes an opportunity to incorporate with them
various cheaper vegetable substances, of which the manufacturer too
often makes use. For the detection of these additions the use of
the microscope is of pre-eminent importance; and, in this regard,
no more useful information could be afforded than by quoting the
following remarks, furnished to the author by Clifford Richardson,
Assistant Chemist of the United States Department of Agriculture, who
has lately made a valuable contribution to the literature of spice
adulteration.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a
href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Spices consist of certain selected parts of aromatic or
pungent plants possessing a characteristic anatomical structure and
proximate composition which, when they have been carefully studied and
recorded, serve as a means of recognising the pure substances when
under examination, and distinguishing them from the different structure
and composition of the adulterants which have been added to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;To carry on an investigation of this description a limited
knowledge of botanical physiology (as well as of proximate chemical
analysis) is therefore necessary. For the physiological part, the
use of the microscope, as a means of determining structure, is
necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The structure of the plant parts which
constitute the spices and their adulterants as well, is
characterised by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>presence or absence of different forms
of cells and of starch, and their relative arrangement. At least, this
is as far as it is necessary to go from the analyst&#8217;s point of
view. By studies of sections of pure whole spices one must become
familiar with the forms usually met with in the spices and those which
are prominent in adulterants and be able to recognise the presence
of starch and by the character of the granules to determine their
source.</p>

<p>&#8220;The common forms of cells which are met with in the spices,
and with which one should be familiar, are known as parenchyma cells,
sclerenchyma cells, those of fibro-vascular bundles, spiral and dotted
cells, and those of peculiar form in the cortex and epidermis.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Parenchyma</i> consists of thin-walled cells, such as are
well illustrated in the interior of a corn-stalk and are found in the
centre of the pepper kernel. They are often filled with starch, as in
the cereals and pepper, but at times are without it, as in the mustard
seed.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sclerenchyma</i>, or stone cells, are of a ligneous character,
their walls being greatly thickened. They are commoner in the
adulterants than in the spices, and are well illustrated in the
shell of the cocoa-nut, in clove stems, and a few are seen in pepper
hulls.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Spiral and Dotted Cells</i> are found in woody tissue, and
their characteristics are denoted by their names. They are more
commonly found in adulterants, and their presence in large amounts
is conclusive, in many instances, of impurity. They may be seen in
sections of cedar-wood and in cocoa-nut shells, and to a small extent
in pepper husks.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The Fibro-vascular Bundles</i>, as their name implies, are
aggregations which appear to the eye, in some instances, as threads
running through the tissue of the plant. They are easily seen in the
cross-section of the corn-stalk, and are common in ground ginger,
having resisted comminution from their fibrous nature. They are made up
of cells of various forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251"
id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The Cells of the Cortex and Epidermis</i> are in many cases
extremely characteristic in form, and of great value for distinguishing
the origin of the substances under examination. They are too numerous
in shape to be particularly described, and are well illustrated in the
husk of mustard, and the pod of <em>Capsicum</em> or cayenne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other forms of tissue are also met with, but not so
prominently as to render it advisable to burden the memory with them at
first, or to seek them before they are met.</p>

<p>&#8220;These forms of cells and their combinations which have been
described, present in addition some peculiarities, aside from their
structure, which assist in distinguishing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parenchyma is optically inactive, and is not stained by
iodine solution, except in so far as its contents are concerned.
Sclerenchyma, the stone cell, is optically active, and in the dark
field of the microscope, with crossed Nicols, appears as shining
silvery cells, displaying their real structure. The fibro-vascular
bundles are stained yellowish brown by iodine, and are thus
differentiated from the surrounding tissue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starch is stained a deep blue, or blue black, by iodine
solution, and since the contents of the parenchyma cells often consist
of much starch, the parenchyma in these cases seems to assume this
colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;To distinguish some of the peculiarities of structure which
have been mentioned requires some little practice and skill, but not
more than is readily acquired with a short experience. There are
however some aids which should not be neglected.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the ground spices it will be found more difficult to
recognise the anatomy of the parts than in a carefully prepared
section. The hardest parts are often the largest particles, and
scarcely at all transparent. The mounting of the material in water or
glycerine will render them more so, but it is necessary to employ some
other means of which two are available. A solution of chloral hydrate
in water, 8 to 5, serves after 24 hours to make the particles less<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
obscure. In many instances also, it has been found advisable to bleach
the deep colour by Schulze&#8217;s method, using nitric acid of 1&middot;1 sp.
gr. and chlorate of potash. When this is done, hard tissue is broken
down and rendered transparent where otherwise nothing could be seen.
As examples, olive stones and cocoa-nut shells will serve. Without
treatment little can be made out of their structure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it is plain that the detection of starch must be
in a portion of the material which has received no treatment, and that
progress must be made from the least to the most violent reagents.</p>

<p>&#8220;For this work an elaborate microscope is unnecessary.
It should, for work with starches, have objectives of
&frac12; and <span class="sup">1</span>&frasl;<span
class="sub">5</span> inch equivalent focus,
arrangements for polarising light, and if possible, a condenser system.
Many good stands are to-day made at reasonable prices which will serve
the purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The microscopical appearance of various starches in polarised
light is shown in Plate IX. Plate XII. exhibits several spices, under
polarised light, in a pure and adulterated state. Those represented
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ginger, pure, and adulterated with foreign starch.</p>

<p>Cinnamon and Cassia; the pure barks, ground, showing the relative
greater frequency of fibro-vascular bundles in the former.</p>

<p>Cayenne, pure, and adulterated with rice starch.</p>

<p>The chemical analysis of spices, although usually of minor
importance, often serves to confirm the results secured by aid of the
microscope. The principal determinations required are the ash, oil,
starch, and sugar. The more common forms of spice adulteration are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cloves.</i>&mdash;This spice is said to be sometimes deprived of its
volatile oil before being put on the market. In the genuine article
the proportion of oil seldom falls below 17 per cent. The oil is
readily estimated by distilling the suspected <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>sample with water. The
usual adulterants of ground cloves consist of clove-stems, allspice,
flour and burnt shells.</p>

<p><i>Mace.</i>&mdash;True mace is frequently mixed with the false spice,
the presence of which is indicated by its dark-red colour. The other
foreign substances most commonly used are turmeric, wheaten flour,
rice, corn meal, and roasted beans.</p>

<p><i>Cinnamon.</i>&mdash;The chief admixtures to be sought for are cassia,
ground shells, crackers, etc.</p>

<p><i>Allspice.</i>&mdash;Owing to its cheapness, allspice is probably less
adulterated than the preceding spices. The addition of mustard-husks,
ground shells, and clove stems, and the removal of the volatile oil,
are, however, sometimes practised. The oil in genuine allspice should
amount to about 5 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Ginger.</i>&mdash;Ginger is likewise comparatively little exposed to
sophistication, although it has occasionally been found coloured with
turmeric, and admixed with corn meal, mustard-husks, cayenne, and clove
stems. It is stated that the manufacturers of ginger extract dispose
of the exhausted article to spice dealers who utilise the impoverished
product for the adulteration of other spices.</p>

<p><i>Mixed Spices.</i>&mdash;These consist of mixtures of the foregoing,
and are liable to the sophistications practised upon their ingredients,
the addition of the cheaper flours and starches being especially
prevalent.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A variety</span> of articles of food, which do
not properly come under any of the heads previously treated, have,
during the past few years, been found on our markets in an adulterated
state. Prominent among these, are the various kinds of canned meats,
fruits, and vegetables, which have not unfrequently been the cause of
serious cases of illness. This result may be owing to the original bad
condition of the goods, or to fermentation having taken place; but, in
many instances, the trouble has been traced to the improper methods of
canning used, resulting in the contamination of the preserved articles
with metallic poisons. The fact that fermentation has occurred is
frequently indicated by the external appearance of the head of the can,
which, in this case, will be slightly convex, instead of being, as it
should be, concave. The metals most often detected in canned goods
are lead, tin, and copper. The presence of lead is usually due to the
use of an impure grade of tin, known as &#8220;terne-plate,&#8221;
in the manufacture of the cans, or to carelessness in the soldering
process. The origin of copper is probably to be found in the methods
sometimes practised of heating the goods in vessels made of this metal
previous to canning them. The presence of tin results from the action
of partially decomposed fruits and vegetables upon the can. Preserved
fruits and jellies are sometimes put up in unsealed tin pails or cans,
when they almost invariably contain notable amounts of this metal.</p>

<p>Asparagus seems to be especially liable to contamination with
metals, doubtless owing to the formation of aspartic acid. As much
as half a gramme of tin has been found in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> a quart can of this
vegetable. The use of zinc chloride as a flux in soldering, has, to the
writer&#8217;s knowledge, occasioned the presence of an appreciable
proportion of the salt in canned goods.</p>

<p>Of 109 samples of canned food lately examined by our health
officials, 97 contained tin; 39, copper; 4, zinc; and 2 lead. In
the analysis of food of this description, the organic matters are
first destroyed by heating with oxidising agents, such as a mixture
of potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid. The solution is then
evaporated to a small volume. It is next diluted with water, and
tested with sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonium sulphide, and the usual
reagents.</p>

<p>Messrs. Waller and Martin have made an investigation in regard to
the proportion of copper which may be present in various natural grains
and vegetables. Their results show that these plants frequently take up
a minute quantity of this metal from the soil. The amounts of copper
found were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Meat extracts, while not subjected to adulteration, have acquired a
popular reputation as articles of food which is not always deserved. As

<p>The factitious manufacture of jellies has lately excited
considerable attention. Many of the more expensive kinds of this
article are imitated by mixtures consisting largely of apple jelly.</p>

<p>A brand of spurious currant jelly, which is manufactured in France,
and has recently made its appearance on the American market, is
prepared from a gelatinous seaweed found in Japan (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arachnoidiscus
Japonicus</i>), to which glucose, tartaric acid, and an artificial essence
of currants are added, the desired colour being obtained by means of
cochineal and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Althea roseata</i>. The product is offered for sale at five
cents a pound.</p>

<p>The flour employed in the manufacture of the maccaroni and
vermicelli commonly met with in our larger cities, is not always
of good quality. A more serious form of adulteration consists in
the artificial colouring of these preparations. The substances
used for this purpose, which have been detected by the public
authorities, are turmeric,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257"
id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> saffron, and chrome yellow. Meat has
been found tinted with aniline red, and Bologna sausages, coated with
iron pigments, have occasionally been encountered.</p>

<p>The flavouring syrups used in connection with the popular American
beverage, &#8220;soda water,&#8221; frequently consist almost wholly
of glucose and artificial compound ethers. Dr. Cyrus Edson, of the New
York City Board of Health, has lately directed public notice to the
fact that many manufacturers of soda water use water obtained from
artesian wells, which are driven on their premises, and which, from the
nature of the geological formation of Manhattan Island, are very liable
to contain sewage contamination.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> No person shall, within this
State, manufacture, have, offer for sale, or sell any article of
food or drugs which is adulterated within the meaning of this Act,
and any person violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanour, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine
not exceeding fifty dollars for the first offence, and not exceeding
one hundred dollars for each subsequent offence.</p>

<p>2. The term &#8220;food,&#8221; as used in this Act, shall

<p>2. If, when sold under or by a name not recognised in the
United States Pharmacop&#339;ia, but which is found in some other
pharmacop&#339;ia or other standard work on Materia Medica, it differs
materially from the standard of strength, quality, or purity laid down
in such work.</p>

<p>3. If its strength or purity fall below the professed standard under
which it is sold.</p>

</div>

<p><i>b.</i>&mdash;In the case of food or drink.</p>

<p>2. If any inferior or cheaper substance or substances have been

approval of the Governor, from time to time declare certain articles or
preparations to be exempt from the provisions of this Act: And provided
further, that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to mixtures or
compounds recognised as ordinary articles of food, provided that the
same are not injurious to health and that the articles are distinctly
labelled as a mixture, stating the components of the mixture.</p>

</div>

<p>4. It shall be the duty of the State Board of Health to prepare and
publish from time to time lists of the articles, mixtures, or compounds
declared to be exempt from the provisions of this Act in accordance
with the preceding section. The State Board of Health shall also from
time to time fix the limits of variability permissible in any article
of food or drug, or compound, the standard of which is not established
by any national pharmacop&#339;ia.</p>

<p>5. The State Board of Health shall take cognisance of the interests
of the public health as it relates to the sale of food and drugs and
the adulteration of the same, and make all necessary investigations
and inquiries relating thereto. It shall also have the supervision
of the appointment of public analysts and chemists, and upon its
recommendation whenever it shall deem any such officers incompetent,
the appointment of any and every such officer shall be revoked and
be held to be void and of no effect. Within thirty days after the
passage of this Act, the State Board of Health shall meet and adopt
such measures as may seem necessary to facilitate the enforcement of
this Act, and prepare rules and regulations with regard to the proper
methods of collecting and examining articles of food or drugs, and for

Board of Health shall be authorised to expend, in addition to all<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>

thousand dollars for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
this Act. And the sum of ten thousand dollars is hereby appropriated
out of any moneys in the treasury, not otherwise appropriated, for the
purposes in this section provided.</p>

<p>6. Every person selling or offering or exposing any article of food
or drugs for sale, or delivering any article to purchasers, shall be
bound to serve or supply any public analyst or other agent of the State
or Local Board of Health appointed under this Act, who shall apply
to him for that purpose, and on his tendering the value of the same,
with a sample sufficient for the purpose of analysis of any article
which is included in this Act, and which is in the possession of the
person selling, under a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars for a
first offence, and one hundred dollars for a second and subsequent
offences.</p>

<p>7. Any violation of the provisions of this Act shall be treated and
punished as a misdemeanour; and whoever shall impede, obstruct, hinder,
or otherwise prevent any analyst, inspector, or prosecuting officer
in the performance of his duty shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and
shall be liable to indictment and punishment therefor.</p>

<p>8. Any Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent with the provisions of
this Act are hereby repealed.</p>

<p>9. All the regulations and declarations of the State Board of Health
made under this Act from time to time, and promulgated, shall be
printed in the statutes at large.</p>

<p>10. This Act shall take effect at the expiration of ninety days
after it shall become a law.</p>

of water or fluids, or less than twelve per centum of milk solids,
which shall contain not less than three per centum of fat, it shall
be declared adulterated, and milk drawn from cows within fifteen days
before, and five days after, parturition, or from animals fed on

prevent the feeding of ensilage from silos.</p>

provisions of this Act by his agent, servant, or in any room or
building occupied or controlled by him, he shall be deemed a principal
in such violation and punished accordingly.</p>

court of this State having jurisdiction thereof in an action to be
prosecuted by the Dairy Commissioner, or any of his assistants in the

<p>20. This Act and each section thereof is declared to be enacted to
prevent deception in the sale of dairy products, and to preserve the
public health which is endangered by the manufacture, sale or use of

<p>The method of testing vinegar, used by Dr. B. F. Davenport, late
Vinegar Inspector of Boston, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following detailed practical method of determining whether
a sample of &#8220;cider vinegar or apple vinegar&#8221; conforms
to the requirements of the Statute of April 1885, relating thereto,
which requires that it should be not only the legitimate and exclusive
product of pure apple juice or cider, but also that it should not fall
below the quality of possessing an acidity equivalent to the presence
of not less than 4&frac12; per cent. by weight of absolute&mdash;that
is, monohydrated&mdash;acetic acid, and should yield upon full
evaporation at the temperature of boiling water not less than 2 per
cent. by weight of cider vinegar solids, may prove of interest to
those dealing in the article. As the limits set by the Statute are in
per cents. by weight, the portion of vinegar taken for the tests<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
should, for perfect accuracy, be also taken by weight&mdash;that is,
the quantities of 6 and of 10 grammes are to be taken for the tests of
strength and of residue; but as taking it by measure, if of about the
ordinary atmospheric temperature of 60 to 70 degrees F. will make the
apparent percentage at most only 1 to 2 per cent. of itself greater
than the true&mdash;that is, will make a true 5 per cent. vinegar
appear to be, say, from 5&middot;05 to 5&middot;10 per cent.&mdash;measuring proves
in practice to be accurate enough for all common commercial purposes,
and therefore the quantities of 6 and of 10 cubic centimetres by
measure may be taken in place of as many grammes.</p>

<p>All the measuring apparatus necessary for making the legal tests
is one of the measuring tubes called burettes. It is most convenient
to have this of a size to contain 25 to 50 c.c.&mdash;that is, cubic
centimetres&mdash;and have these divided into tenths. The best form
of burette is the Mohr&#8217;s, which is closed by a glass stop-cock.
Besides this, only a dropping-tube, called a pipette, graduated to
deliver 6 and 10 c.c., will be needed. These tubes are to be obtained
of any philosophical or chemical apparatus dealer, being articles
generally kept in stock by them for common use, like yard-sticks.</p>

<p>The only two chemicals needed in determining the strength of a
vinegar are such as can be obtained of any competent apothecary in
any city of the State. They are simply a small vial of a 1 per cent.
solution of Phenol-phthalein in diluted alcohol, and a sufficient
quantity of a solution of caustic soda, prepared as directed for
&#8220;Volumetric Solution of Soda&#8221; upon page 399 of the last
&#8216;U. S. Pharmacop&#339;ia,&#8217; a book which is in the hands of
every competent apothecary, as it contains the formul&aelig; according
to which he is required by the law of the State to prepare all such
medicinal preparations as are mentioned therein.</p>

<p>Having these, the procedure for making the test will be as
follows:&mdash;Fill the pipette by suction, and then quickly close
the top of it with the forefinger. Raise the tube out of the sample
of vinegar, and let it empty out by drops exactly down to the top
graduation-mark, this bearing the mark of 0&middot; c.c. Then holding it
over a white mug or cup, let it run out exactly down to the 6 c.c.
mark. Dilute the 6 c.c. of vinegar thus measured out into the mug with
sufficient clean water to make it look about white, and then add to
it about three drops of the Phenol-phthalein solution. Then having
prepared the burette by filling it up to the top, zero, or any other
noted mark of the graduation, with the volumetric solution of soda, let
the soda solution run out cautiously into the diluted vinegar, which
should be constantly stirred about. As soon as the vinegar in the mug
begins to darken, the soda should then only be allowed to run into it
by drops. This dropping is thus continued until at last a final drop of
soda turns the vinegar suddenly to a permanent pink or cherry colour,
which will not disappear upon further stirring. By now reading off
from the graduations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293"
id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> burette the number of full c.c.
divisions and of tenths which have been emptied out to bring about this
change of colour in the vinegar is known the per cents. and tenths of
acidity equivalent to true acetic acid contained in the vinegar being
examined. This, if it is a pure cider vinegar, and well made, will be
upon the average about 6 per cent., but never under 5 per cent. If,
in like manner, 10 c.c. of the vinegar is exactly measured off by the
pipette into a small light porcelain dish, and then evaporated fully
to dryness over boiling water, the number of grammes weight gained by
the dish, when multiplied by ten, gives the percentage of solid residue
contained in the vinegar.</p>

<p>There are certain characteristics peculiar to the residue of a pure
cider vinegar, the principal of which are the following:&mdash;It will
be about 3 per cent. in weight, and never less than 2 per cent. It is
always soft, viscid, of apple flavour, somewhat acid and astringent in
taste. A drop of it taken up in a clean loop of platinum or of iron
wire, and ignited in a colourless Bunsen gas-lamp flame, imparts to
it the pale lilac colour of a pure potash salt, without any yellow,
due to sodium, being visible. The ignited residue left in the loop of
wire will be a fusible bead of quite a good size, and it will have
a strong alkaline reaction upon moistened test-paper, effervescing
briskly when immersed in an acid. The presence in a vinegar of the
<em>slightest</em> trace of any free mineral acid will prevent the ignited
residue having any alkaline reaction, or effervescing with acids.
The presence of any practical amount of commercial acetic acid added
to &#8220;tone up&#8221; the strength of the vinegar will cause the
igniting residue to impart another colour to the Bunsen flame, and
the residue itself will have a smoky pyroligneous taste or odour. Any
corn glucose used in the vinegar will cause its residue when ignited
to emit the characteristic odour of burning corn, and, as the last
spark glows through the carbonised mass, to usually emit the familiar
garlic odour of arsenic, for the common oil of vitriol usually used in
the production of glucose is now mostly derived from pyrites, which
almost always contain arsenic. A glucose vinegar which has been made
without vaporising the alcohol after the fermentation of the glucose
will also have a strong reducing action upon a copper salt in an
alkaline solution, and also will give a heavy precipitation of lime
with ammonium oxalate. A true malt vinegar always contains phosphates,
and a wine vinegar cream of tartar. The presence of any acrid vegetable
substance in a vinegar is known by the residue having a pungent taste,
especially if before the evaporation the vinegar has been exactly
neutralised with soda.</p>

<p>In a pure apple cider vinegar hydrogen sulphide gas will not cause
any discoloration, nor will the addition of a solution of either barium
nitrate, silver nitrate, or ammonium oxalate cause anything more than
the <em>very slightest</em> perceptible turbidity. But the addition of some
solution of lead acetate&mdash;that is, of sugar of lead&mdash;will
cause an immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"
id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> voluminous and flocculent precipitation,
which will all settle out in about ten minutes, leaving a clear fluid
above. In most of the so-called &#8220;apple vinegars,&#8221; made
with second pressings of the fermenting pumice, the addition of some
of this lead solution will cause but a slight turbidity, without
any precipitate settling out for several hours, and even then the
precipitate will not be of the same appearance as in apple cider
vinegar.</p>

<p>Sophistications of cider vinegar that will not be detected by some
one or more of the above given tests are not likely to be met with,
for the simple reason that they are not profitable. To translate
percentages of acid strength into the old commercial terms of grains
of soda bicarbonate per troy ounce, the per cent. may be multiplied by
6&middot;72, or, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice vers&acirc;</i>, divide the grains by the same factor. To
reduce it into grains of potash bicarbonate 8 would be the factor to be
used in like manner.</p></div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The New Jersey State Board of Health has adopted the following rules
for the government of its inspectors and analysts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Duties of
Inspectors.</span></p>

<p>1. The inspector is to buy samples of food or drugs, and to seal
each sample in the presence of a witness.</p>

<p>2. The inspector must affix to each sample a label bearing a number,
his initials, and the date of purchase.</p>

<p>3. Under no circumstance is the inspector to inform the analyst
as to the source of the sample before the analysis shall have been
completed and formally reported to the President or Secretary of the
State Board of Health.</p>

<p>4. Inspectors are to keep a record of each sample as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent hang">(1)  Number of sample.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(2) Date and time of purchase.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(3) Name of witness to sealing.</p>

<p class="noindent hang"><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>(4)
Name and address of seller.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(5) Name and address of producer, manufacturer
or wholesaler, when known, with marks on original package.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(6) Name of analyst and date of sending.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(7) How sent to analyst.</p>

</div>

<p>5.  If the seller desires a portion of the sample, the inspector is to
deliver it under seal. The duplicate sample left with seller should
have a label containing the same marks as are affixed to the portion
taken by the inspector.</p>

<p>6.  The inspector is to deliver the sample to the analyst, taking his
receipt for the same, or he may send it by registered mail, express or
special messenger.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Duties of the
Analysts.</span></p>

<p>1. The analyst is to analyse the samples immediately upon receipt
thereof.</p>

<p>2. Samples, with the exception of milk and similar perishable
articles, are to be divided by the analyst and a portion sealed up,
and a copy of the original label affixed. These duplicates are to be
sent to the Secretary of the State Board of Health at the end of each
month, and to be retained by him until demanded for another analysis,
as provided for in section 3 of these Rules.</p>

<p>3. Should the result obtained by any analyst be disputed in any
case, an appeal may be made to the State Board of Health, through
its secretary, by the defendant or person selling the sample, or his
attorney, and said secretary shall then require another member of
the Committee of Public Analysts to repeat the analysis, using the
duplicate sample for such purpose. But when an appeal shall be made, a
sum of money sufficient to cover the expenses of the second analysis
shall be deposited with the President of the State Board of Health,
which sum shall be paid over to the analyst designated by the President
and Secretary of the Board to perform the second analysis, in case
the analysis shall be found to agree with the first in all essential
particulars.</p>

<p>4. In the case of all articles having a standard of purity fixed by
any of the laws of the State, the certificate of the analyst should
show the relation of the article in question to that standard.</p>

<p>5. Where standards of strength, purity or quality are not fixed by
law, the Committee of Analysts shall present to the State Board of
Health such standard as in their judgment should be fixed.</p>

<p>6. Each analyst should keep a record book, in which should be
entered notes, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent hang">(1) From whom the sample is received.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(2) Date, time and manner in which the sample
was received.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(3) Marks on package, sealed or not.</p>

<p class="noindent hang">(4) Results of analysis in detail.</p>

</div>

<p>This record should be produced at each meeting of the committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299"
id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>7. At the completion of the analysis a certificate in the form given
below should be forwarded to the person from whom the sample was
received, and a duplicate copy sent to the State Board of Health.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Certificate.</span></p>

Law is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in
Congress assembled. That for the purposes of this Act the word
&#8220;butter&#8221; shall be understood to mean the food product
usually known as butter, and which is made exclusively from milk or
cream, or both, with or without common salt, and with or without
additional colouring matter.</p>

<p>2. That for the purposes of this Act certain manufactured substances
certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such
mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known and designated
as &#8220;oleomargarine,&#8221; namely: All substances heretofore
known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine,
suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo,

colouring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or
semblance of butter, or when so made, calculated or intended to be sold
as butter or for butter.</p>

<p>3. That special taxes are imposed as follows:&mdash;Manufacturers
of oleomargarine shall pay six hundred dollars. Every person who
manufactures oleomargarine for sale shall be deemed a manufacturer of
oleomargarine.</p>

<p>4. Wholesale dealers in oleomargarine shall pay four hundred
and eighty dollars. Every person who sells or offers for sale
oleomargarine in the original manufacturer&#8217;s packages shall be
deemed a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine. But any manufacturer of
oleomargarine who has given the required bond and paid the required
special tax, and who sells only oleomargarine of his own production,
at the place of manufacture, in the original packages to which the
tax-paid stamps are affixed, shall not be required to pay the special
tax of a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine on account of such sale.</p>

<p>Retail dealers in oleomargarine shall pay forty-eight dollars. Every
person who sells oleomargarine in less quantities than ten pounds at
one time shall be regarded as a retail dealer in oleomargarine. And
Sections 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3236, 3237, 3238, 3239, 3240, 3241,
and 3243 of the Revised Statutes of the United States are, so far as
applicable, made to extend to and include and apply to the special
taxes imposed by this section, and to the persons upon whom they are
imposed. (See page 10 for Revised Statutes.) Provided, That in case
any manufacturer of oleomargarine commences business subsequent to the
thirtieth day of June in any year, the special tax shall be reckoned
from the first day of July in that year, and shall be five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>4. That every person who carries on the business of
a manufacturer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> of oleomargarine without having paid the
special tax therefor, as required by law, shall, besides being liable
to the payment of the tax, be fined not less than one thousand dollars
and not more than five thousand dollars; and every person who carries
on the business of a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine without having
paid the special tax therefor, as required by law, shall, besides
being liable to the payment of the tax, be fined not less than five
hundred dollars nor more than two thousand dollars, and every person
who carries on the business of a retail dealer in oleomargarine without
having paid the special tax therefor, as required by law, shall,
besides being liable to the payment of the tax, be fined not less than
fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars for each and every
offence.</p>

<p>5. That every manufacturer of oleomargarine shall file with the
Collector of Internal Revenue of the district in which his manufactory
is located, such notices, inventories, and bonds, shall keep such books
and render such returns of materials and products, shall put up such
signs and affix such number to his factory, and conduct his business
under such surveillance of officers and agents as the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury
may, by regulation, require. But the bond required of such manufacturer
shall be with sureties satisfactory to the Collector of Internal
Revenue, and in a penal sum of not less than five thousand dollars,
and the sum of said bond may be increased from time to time, and
additional sureties required at the discretion of the Collector, or
under instructions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>

<p>6. That all oleomargarine shall be packed by the manufacturer
thereof in firkins, tubs, or other wooden packages not before used for
that purpose, each containing not less than ten pounds, and marked,
stamped and branded as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the
approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe; and all
sales made by manufacturers of oleomargarine and wholesale dealers in
oleomargarine shall be in original stamped packages. Retail dealers
in oleomargarine must sell only from original stamped packages, in
quantities not exceeding ten pounds, and shall pack the oleomargarine
sold by them in suitable wooden or paper packages, which shall be
marked and branded as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the
approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe. Every
person who knowingly sells or offers for sale, or delivers or offers
to deliver, any oleomargarine in any other form than in new wooden or
paper packages as above described, or who packs in any package any
oleomargarine in any manner contrary to law, or who falsely brands any
package or affixes a stamp on any package denoting a less amount of tax
than that required by law, shall be fined for each offence not more
than one thousand dollars, and be imprisoned not less than six months
nor more than two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310"
id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>7. That every manufacturer of oleomargarine shall securely affix,
by pasting, on each package containing oleomargarine manufactured by
him, a label on which shall be printed, besides the number of the
manufactory and the district and State in which it is situated, these
words:&mdash;&#8220;Notice.&mdash;The manufacturer of the oleomargarine
herein contained has complied with all the requirements of law. Every
person is cautioned not to use this package again or the stamp thereon
again nor to remove the contents of this package without destroying
said stamp, under the penalty provided by law in such cases.&#8221;
Every manufacturer of oleomargarine who neglects to affix such label to
any package containing oleomargarine made by him, or sold or offered
for sale by or for him, and every person who removes any such label so
affixed from any such package, shall be fined fifty dollars for each
package in respect to which such offence is committed.</p>

<p>8. That upon oleomargarine which shall be manufactured and sold, or
removed for consumption or use, there shall be assessed and collected a
tax of two cents per pound, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and
any fractional part of a pound in a package shall be taxed as a pound.
The tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps;
and the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue,
sale, accountability, effacement and destruction of stamps relating to
tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to
stamps provided for by this section.</p>

<p>9. That whenever any manufacturer of oleomargarine sells, or removes
for sale or consumption, any oleomargarine upon which the tax is
required to be paid by stamps, without the use of the proper stamps,
it shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, within
a period of not more than two years after such sale or removal, upon
satisfactory proof, to estimate the amount of tax which has been
omitted to be paid, and to make an assessment therefor and certify the
same to the collector. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the
penalties imposed by law for such sale or removal.</p>

<p>10. That all oleomargarine imported from foreign countries shall,
in addition to any import duty imposed on the same, pay an internal
revenue tax of 15 cents per pound, such tax to be represented by
coupon stamps as in the case of oleomargarine manufactured in the
United States. The stamps shall be affixed and cancelled by the owner
or importer of the oleomargarine while it is in the custody of the
proper custom-house officers; and the oleomargarine shall not pass out
of the custody of said officers until the stamps have been so affixed
and cancelled, but shall be put up in wooden packages, each containing
not less than ten pounds; as prescribed in this Act for oleomargarine
manufactured in the United States, before the stamps are affixed; and
the owner or importer of such oleomargarine shall be liable to all
the penal provisions of this Act prescribed for manufacturers<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of oleomargarine manufactured in the United States. Whenever it is
necessary to take any oleomargarine so imported to any place other than
the public stores of the United States for the purpose of affixing and
cancelling such stamps, the Collector of Customs of the port where such
oleomargarine is entered, shall designate a bonded warehouse to which
it shall be taken, under the control of such customs officer as such
collector shall direct; and every officer of customs who permits such
oleomargarine to pass out of his custody or control without compliance
by the owner or importer thereof with the provisions of this section
relating thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and shall be fined
not less than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars,
and imprisoned not less than six months nor more than three years.

or oleomargarine purporting or claimed to have been imported, not put
up in packages and stamped as provided by this Act, shall be fined not
less than five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, and
be imprisoned not less than six months nor more than two years.</p>

<p>11. That every person who knowingly purchases or receives for sale
any oleomargarine which has not been branded or stamped according
to law, shall be liable to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such
offence.</p>

<p>12. That every person who knowingly purchases or receives for sale
any oleomargarine from any manufacturer who has not paid the special
tax shall be liable for each offence to a penalty of one hundred
dollars, and to forfeiture of all articles so purchased or received, or
of the full value thereof.</p>

<p>13. That whenever any stamped package containing oleomargarine is
emptied, it shall be the duty of the person in whose hands the same
is to destroy utterly the stamps thereon, and any person who wilfully
neglects or refuses so to do shall for each such offence be fined not
exceeding fifty dollars, and imprisoned not less than ten days nor more
than six months. And any person who fraudulently gives away or accepts
from another, or who sells, buys, or uses for packing oleomargarine,
any such stamped package, shall for each such offence be fined not
exceeding one hundred dollars and be imprisoned not more than one year.
Any revenue officer may destroy any emptied oleomargarine package upon
which the tax-paid stamp is found.</p>

<p>14. That there shall be in the office of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue an analytical chemist and a microscopist, who
shall each be appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and
shall each receive a salary of two thousand five hundred dollars
per annum; and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may, whenever
in his judgment the necessities of the service so require, employ
chemists and microscopists, to be paid such compensation as he
may deem proper, not exceeding in the aggregate any appropriation
made for that purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312"
id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> And such commissioner is authorised to
decide what substances, extracts, mixtures or compounds which may be
submitted for his inspection in contested cases are to be taxed under
this Act; and his decision in matters of taxation under this Act shall
be final. The commissioner may also decide whether any substances

Navy, and the Commissioner of Agriculture, and the decisions of this
body shall be final in the premises.</p>

<p>15. That all packages of oleomargarine subject to tax under this Act
that shall be found without stamps or marks as herein provided, and all
oleomargarine intended for human consumption which contains ingredients

production of oleomargarine found in the factory and on the factory
premises, and shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor
more than five thousand dollars, and be imprisoned not less than six
months nor more than three years.</p>

for consumption or use, on or after the day this Act takes effect;
and such stock on hand at the time of the taking effect of this Act
may be stamped, marked and branded under special regulations of the

Law:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That from and after the passage of this Act it
shall be unlawful for any person or persons or corporation to import
or bring into the United States any merchandise for sale as tea,
adulterated with spurious leaf or with exhausted leaves, or which
contains so great an admixture of chemicals or other deleterious
substances as to make it unfit for use; and the importation of all such
merchandise is hereby prohibited.</p>

<p>2. That on making entry at the custom house of all tea or
merchandise described as tea imported into the United States,
the importer or consignee shall give a bond to the collector
of the port that such merchandise shall not be removed from
warehouse until released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314"

who shall examine it with reference to its purity and fitness for
consumption; and that for the purpose of such examination samples
of each line in every invoice shall be submitted by the importer or
consignee to the examiner, with his written statement that such samples
represent the true quality of each and every part of the invoice,
and accord with the specification therein contained; and in case the
examiner has reason to believe that such samples do not represent the
true quality of the invoice, he shall make such further examination of
the tea represented by the invoice, or any part thereof, as shall be
necessary: Provided, That such further examination of such tea shall be
made within three days after entry thereof has been made at the custom
house: And provided further, That the bond above required shall also
be conditioned for the payment of all custom house charges which may
attach to such merchandise prior to being released or destroyed (as the
case may be) under the provisions of this Act.</p>

tea is found by the examiner not to come within the prohibition of this
Act, a permit shall at once be granted to the importer or consignee
declaring the tea free from the control of the custom authorities;
but if on examination such tea, or merchandise described as tea, is
found, in the opinion of the examiner, to come within the prohibitions
of this Act, the importer or consignee shall be immediately notified,
and the tea, or merchandise described as tea, so returned shall not be
released by the custom house, unless on a re-examination called for by
the importer or consignee, the return of the examiner shall be found
erroneous: Provided, That should a portion of the invoice be passed

remainder held for further examination, as provided in section four.</p>

<p>4. That in case of any dispute between the importer or consignee and
the examiner, the matter in dispute shall be referred for arbitration

collector, to export such tea, or merchandise described as tea, out of
the limits of the United States, within a period of six months after
such final re-examination; but if the same shall not have been exported
within the time specified, the collector, at the expiration of that
time shall cause the same to be destroyed.</p>

<p>5. That the examination and appraisement herein provided for shall
be made by a duly qualified appraiser of the port at which said tea

<p class="p2">The following is the text of the California Wine
Adulteration Law, passed Feb. 17th, 1887:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>The People of the State of California, represented
in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> For the purposes of this Act,
pure wine shall be defined as follows: The juice of grapes fermented,
preserved, or fortified for use as a beverage, or as a medicine, by
methods recognised as legitimate according to the provisions of this
Act; unfermented grape juice, containing no addition of distilled
spirits, may be denominated according to popular custom and demand as
wine only when described as &#8220;unfermented wine,&#8221; and shall
be deemed pure only when preserved for use as a beverage or medicine,
in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Pure grape must shall
be deemed to be the juice of grapes, only, in its natural condition,
whether expressed or mingled with the pure skins, seeds, or stems of
grapes. Pure condensed grape must shall be deemed to be pure grape
must from which water has been extracted by evaporation for purposes
of preservation or increase of saccharine strength. Dry wine is that
produced by complete fermentation of saccharine contained in must.
Sweet wine is that which contains more or less saccharine appreciable
to the taste. Fortified wine is that wine to which distilled spirits
have been added to increase alcoholic strength, for purposes of
preservation only, and shall be held to be pure, when the spirits so
used are the product of the grape only. Pure champagne or sparkling
wine is that which contains carbonic acid gas or effervescence produced
only by natural fermentation of saccharine matter of musts, or
partially fermented wine in bottle.</p>

<p>2. In the fermentation, preservation, and fortification
of pure wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316"
id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> it shall be specifically understood
that no materials shall be used intended as substitutes for grapes,
or any part of grapes; no colouring matters shall be added which are
not the pure products of grapes during fermentation, or by extraction
from grapes with the aid of pure grape spirits; no foreign fruit
juices, and no spirits imported from foreign countries, whether pure or
compounded with fruit juices, or other material not the pure product
of grapes, shall be used for any purpose; no aniline dyes, salicylic
acid, glycerine, alum, or other chemical antiseptics, or ingredients
recognised as deleterious to the health of consumers, or as injurious
to the reputation of wine as pure, shall be permitted; and no distilled
spirits shall be added except for the sole purpose of preservation,
and without the intention of enabling trade to lengthen the volume of
fortified dry wine by the addition of water, or other wine weaker in
alcoholic strength.</p>

<p>3. In the fermentation and preservation of pure wine, and during
the operations of fining or clarifying, removing defects, improving
qualities, blending and maturing, no methods shall be employed which
essentially conflict with the provisions of the preceding sections
of this Act, and no materials shall be used for the promotion of
fermentation, or the assistance of any of the operations of wine
treatment which are injurious to the consumer or the reputation of wine
as pure; <em>provided</em>, that it shall be expressly understood that the
practices of using pure tannin in small quantities, leaven to excite
fermentation only, and not to increase the material for the production
of alcohol; water before or during, but not after fermentation, for
the purpose of decreasing the saccharine strength of musts to enable
perfect fermentation; and the natural products of grapes in the pure
forms as they exist in pure grape musts, skins, and seeds; sulphur
fumes, to disinfect cooperage and prevent disease in wine; and
pure gelatinous and albuminous substances, for the sole purpose of
assisting fining or clarification, shall be specifically permitted in
the operations hereinbefore mentioned, in accordance with recognised
legitimate custom.</p>

<p>4. It shall be unlawful to sell, or expose, or offer to sell under
the name of wine, or grape musts, or condensed musts, or under any
names designating pure wines, or pure musts as hereinbefore classified
and defined, or branded, labelled, or designated in any way as wine or
musts, or by any name popularly and commercially used as a designation
of wine produced from grapes, such as claret, burgundy, hock, sauterne,
port, sherry, madeira, and angelica, any substance, or compound,
except pure wine, or pure grape must, or pure grape condensed must,
as defined by this Act, and produced in accordance with and subject
to restrictions herein set forth; <em>provided</em>, that this Act shall
not apply to liquors imported from any foreign country, which are
taxed upon entry by custom laws in accordance with a specific duty
and contained in original packages or vessels and prominently<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
branded, labelled, or marked so as to be known to all persons as
foreign products, excepting, however, when such liquors shall contain
adulterations of artificial colouring matters, antiseptic chemicals, or
other ingredients known to be deleterious to the health of consumers;
<em>and provided further</em>, that this Act shall not apply to currant wine,
gooseberry wine, or wines made from other fruits than the grape, which
are labelled or branded and designated and sold, or offered or exposed
for sale under names, including the word wine, but also expressing
distinctly the fruit from which they are made, as gooseberry wine,
elderberry wine, or the like. Any violation of any of the provisions of
any of the preceding sections shall be a misdemeanour.</p>

<p>5. Exceptions from the provisions of this Act shall be made in the
case of pure champagne, or sparkling wine, so far as to permit the use
of crystallised sugar in sweetening the same according to usual custom,
but in no other respect.</p>

<p>6. In all sales and contracts for sale, production, or delivery
of products defined in this Act, such products, in the absence of a
written agreement to the contrary, shall be presumed to be pure as
herein defined, and such sale or contracts shall, in the absence of
such an agreement, be void, if it be established that the products so
sold or contracted for were not pure as herein defined. And in such
case the concealment of the true character of such products shall
constitute actual fraud for which damages may be recovered, and in
a judgment for damages, reasonable attorney fees to be fixed by the
Court, shall be taxed as costs.</p>

<p>7. The Controller of the State shall cause to have engraved plates,
from which shall be printed labels which shall set forth that the wine
covered by such labels is pure California wine in accordance with this
Act, and leaving blanks for the name of the particular kind of wine,
and the name or names of the seller of the wine and place of business.
These labels shall be of two forms or shapes, one a narrow strip to cap
over the corks of bottles, the other, round or square, and sufficiently
large, say three inches square, to cover the bungs of packages in which
wine is sold. Such labels shall be furnished upon proper application to
actual residents, and to be used in this State only, and only to those
who are known to be growers, manufacturers, traders, or handlers, or
bottlers of California wine, and such parties will be required to file
a sworn statement with said Controller, setting forth that his or their
written application for such labels is and will be for his or their
sole use and benefit, and that he or they will not give, sell, or loan
such label to any other person or persons whomsoever. Such labels shall
be paid for at the same rate and price as shall be found to be the
actual cost price to the State, and shall be supplied from time to time
as needed upon the written application of such parties as are before
mentioned. Such label when affixed to bottle or wine package<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> shall
be so affixed, that by drawing the cork from bottle or opening the bung
of package, such label shall be destroyed by such opening; and before
affixing such labels all blanks shall be filled out by stating the
variety or kind of wine that is contained in such bottle or package,
and also by the name or names and Post Office address of such grower,
manufacturer, trader, handler, or bottler of such wine.</p>

<p>8. It is desired and required that all and every grower,
manufacturer, trader, handler, or bottler of California wine, when
selling or putting up for sale any California wine, or when shipping
California wine to parties to whom sold, shall plainly stencil, brand,
or have printed where it will be easily seen, first, &#8220;Pure
California Wine,&#8221; and secondly his name, or the firm&#8217;s
name, as the case may be, both on label of bottle or package in which
wine is sold and sent, or he may, in lieu thereof, if he so prefers
and elects, affix the label which has been provided for in section
seven. It shall be unlawful to affix any such stamp or label as above
provided to any vessel containing any substance other than pure wine,
as herein defined, or to prepare or use on any vessel containing any
liquid any imitation or counterfeit of such stamp, or any paper in
the similitude or resemblance thereof, or any paper of such form and
appearance as to be calculated to mislead or deceive any unwary person,
or cause him to suppose the contents of such vessel to be pure wine.
It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, other than the ones
for whom such stamps were procured, to in any way use such stamps, or
to have possession of the same. A violation of any of the provisions
of this section shall be a misdemeanour, and punishable by fine of not
less than fifty dollars and not more than five hundred dollars, or by
imprisonment in the county jail for a term of not exceeding ninety
days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. All moneys collected by
virtue of prosecutions had against persons violating any provisions of
this or any preceding sections shall go one half to the informer and
one half to the District Attorney prosecuting the same.</p>

<p>9. It shall be the duty of the Controller to keep an account, in a
book to be kept for that purpose, of all stamps, the number, design,
time when, and to whom furnished. The parties procuring the same are
hereby required to return to the Controller semi-annual statements
under oath, setting forth the number used, and how many remain on hand.
Any violation of this section, by the person receiving such stamps, is
a misdemeanour.</p>

<p>10. It shall be the duty of any and all persons receiving
such stamps to use the same only in their business, in no manner
or in nowise to allow the same to be disposed of except in the
manner authorised by this Act; to not allow the same to be used
by any other person or persons. It shall be their duty to become
satisfied that the wine contained in the barrels or bottles is all
that said label imports as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319"
id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> defined by this Act. That they will
use the said stamps only in this State, and shall not permit the same
to part from their possession, except with the barrels, packages, or
bottles upon which they are placed as provided by this Act. A violation
of any of the provisions of this section is hereby made a felony.</p>

<p>12. This Act shall take effect and be in force ninety days after its
passage.</p></div>

<p>When the very delicate article of <b>CORN STARCH</b>, which is so
largely used in the family for food, and especially for children and
invalids, is adulterated with poisonous and unhealthy substances, it
becomes very important that every housekeeper should be cautious and
know what kind they use.</p>

<p>The evidence of such adulteration is most signally shown in the
following proof, which is by one of the most eminent food analysts of
Great Britain, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I recently purchased, on the same day and in the same
neighborhood, a series of eight samples of starch, paying for them
three different prices. On subjecting them to analysis, I found the
whole of them to be adulterated with 20, 30, and even nearly 40 per
cent. of earthy or mineral matter. This I found to consist of mineral
white, terra alba, or sulphate of lime.&#8221;&mdash;Letter in the
London <cite>Times</cite>, October 5th, 1878.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) ARTHUR H. HASSALL, M.D.</p>

<p>Only a careful chemical analysis will show the
pure article from the adulterated.</p>

<p class="ph2">KINGSFORD&#8217;S OSWEGO STARCH</p>

chemical analysis, and found the samples without exception to be of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
